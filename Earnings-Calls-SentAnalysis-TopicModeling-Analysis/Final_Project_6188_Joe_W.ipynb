Adjusting for the week shift, last year's comparable store sales increase would have been 2.6%\\nAs we indicated in our last earnings call, we anticipated Q1 to be a challenging sales quarter\\nIf you recall the first quarter last year benefited from very cold weather in January, which drove the sale of winter related items\\nQ1 of last year also benefited from both warm March temperatures and an early Easter, which drove sales of early spring merchandise\\nUnfortunately, we experienced a complete opposite situation in first quarter 2017. In this year's first quarter, January and February weather was very warm, and we then had cooler temperatures and snow in March\\nJanuary and February's warmer than normal conditions of this year impacted demand for winter seasonal products\\nAdditionally, the March winter storms, which primarily hit the Midwest and Northeast, but also reached down into parts of the Southern regions quickly silenced any early demand for spring seasonal products\\nThe impact on comp sales from softness in seasonal products was relatively equal between winter and spring seasonal goods\\nSales were weakest in the Northern regions of the country where the impact of weather was most pronounced, both in winter and spring seasonal products\\nThe Southern regions were less impacted by the weather conditions, but we're cycling a tough compare from last year's strong performance\\nThe difference in comp sales performance between the Northern and Southern regions, excluding the Western region was approximately 600 basis points\\nThe Western region which experienced less weather volatility had a solid mid single-digit comp sales growth\\nWe continue to see strength in the Western region as we expand our store base and gain market awareness and share\\nWe continue to experience increased demand for many of our basic everyday items, such as our livestock and pet category, which generated low single-digit comparable chain-wide sales\\nExcluding the impact of certain weather influenced categories, such as bird feeding, animal health and fencing, we continue to be pleased with the overall performance of this category\\nWhile there is a seasonal component to the livestock and pet category, we were pleased with the continued increase in comp units and sales dollars in the pet food and animal feed categories\\nAnd we see no evidence that we are losing market share in this core area of the business\\nComp transaction count decreased 1.4% compared to a reported 4.2% increase last year or 2.6% in the prior year adjusted for the week shift\\nThe growth in many of our C\\nitems such as pet and animal food was more than offset by the lack of demand in winter seasonal products such as heating units and insulated outerwear and spring seasonal products such as lawn and garden, animal health and ag chemicals\\nThe average ticket decreased by approximately 90 basis points\\nBig ticket sales declined and deflation were the two primary drivers of this quarter's average ticket decrease\\nComparable sales of big ticket items were down high single-digits year-over-year\\nThe comparable sales decline of big ticket items was primarily driven by a slower start to spring seasonal products such as riding lawn mowers, 3-point equipment and trailers, as well as continued softness in the safe business\\nDeflation was slightly higher than we anticipated at approximately 50 basis points, driven principally by heating fuel, bird feed, livestock feed and lubricant categories\\nAs Greg stated, the weather shifted to more typical spring conditions in early April\\nAnd as a result, we have seen consumer demand increase\\nAlso as a reminder, Petsense store sales are not reflected in same-store sales, as those will fall into the store base, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017. Now turning to gross margin, which decreased 60 basis points to 33.1%, compared to a 30 basis point increase in the prior year\\nIn certain cold weather seasonal products where there was limited demand, we increased markdowns to ensure that we ended the season in a clean inventory position\\nAdditionally, we were slightly more promotional in our efforts to drive sales by creating value for our customer\\nFreight negatively impacted gross margin, principally due to a greater mix of freight intensive categories, growth in our e-commerce business and to a lesser extent, higher average fuel costs\\nThe mix of merchandise had a slightly negative impact on gross margin\\nThis was driven by the strength of sales in C\\nproduct, specifically animal and pet food, which are below chain average margin categories\\nPetsense provided a benefit to gross margin as they produced a higher rate than Tractor Supply stores\\nAlso, it should be noted that last year in the first quarter margin benefited approximately 15 basis points from vendor support programs associated with the initial stocking of our new Arizona DC\\nFor the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization deleveraged by 70 basis points to 27% of sales compared to 26.3% of sales in the prior year's quarter\\nThe primary driver of the deleverage was the decline in comparable store sales\\nA few other factors impacting SG&A ratio were Petsense, which operates at a higher SG&A rate and a greater investment in store payroll hours as part of our focus on enhancing the customer experience\\nAnd then as a partial offset to the deleverage, we estimate that incentive compensation provided approximately 35 basis points of year-over-year leverage\\nOur effective income tax rate for the quarter was 35.6% compared to 36.8% last year\\nThe reduction in rate is principally due to the favorable impact of the adoption of the new accounting rules related to the recognition of incremental tax benefit on stock option exercises\\nThe impact is typically strongest in the first quarter due to the timing of equity vesting and a smaller income base in Q1. And thus, we do not expect similar benefit in future quarters\\nWe continue to estimate our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 36.2% to 36.4%\\nTurning to the balance sheet\\nAt the end of the first quarter, we had a cash balance of $73 million and $611 million outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $75 million and $250 million outstanding debt last year\\nDuring the first quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired 1.6 million shares for $115 million\\nThe consolidated average inventory per store decline of 3.4% reflects the impact of Petsense stores on the chain average\\nExclusive of Petsense average inventory levels per store increased 4.2%, principally due to the timing of our spring seasonal build and to some extent, the timing of seasonal sales\\nWith respect to our outlook, we are not updating our guidance at this time, as we have said for many years, we know that weather can impact the timing of sales this time of the year and we believe it's best to evaluate our performance based on the halves rather than the quarters\\nWhile our Q1 performance was disappointing, there is still a lot of business ahead of us in the spring summer season, therefore we believe, it is prudent to revisit our guidance at the end of the second quarter\\nThat concludes our prepared remarks\\nOperator, we will now turn the call over for questions\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nNo, I will just say I agree, because Steve hit that important point, Seth in that, it's the input costs that are a key part to that\\nSo, our deflation calculation is not quoting situations where there maybe retail declines without a cost change\\nSigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay\\nSimeon, Kurt\\nA couple things on that\\nSo we continue to evaluate our long-term targets, and as just a reminder, our long-term targets that we've set is high single-digit total sales growth, which include some solid comp store sales in that picture\\nTo Greg's point, one quarter of tough weather conditions or a couple of quarters there are not going to change our long-term targets\\nWe still see the strength in the business, and our sales growth driving initiative ability to drive the high single-digit sales growth\\nOne reminder is, when it comes to Q2, I think as was mentioned, in Q2, we do have one less comp sales day, that we know is part of the headwind that we're facing as part of Q2.\\nYeah, Michael\\nFirst as we said, given the seasonality of the business and the weather conditions in first quarter, we're not updating guidance at this time\\nReminding that first quarter is the lowest volume sales and earnings quarter for that, that's the primary reason, it's about 15% of sales and earnings for the year\\nSo at this point with being so early in the year and we recognize those factors that you brought up, at this point, it's just too early to give any guidance on the year\\nYeah, Stephen, Kurt, I'll address the second part of it\\nAnd it might be helpful as a data point to refer back to our pull forward discussion from last year\\nAt the end our Q1, we estimated that number at about $18 million\\nAnd then, as we reported Q2 and saw the results in April more information settled we estimated at about $25 million\\nTo have it more of a comparable number for this year, with the week shift in moving that week into Q1, but April shifting to Q2, our estimate is for this quarter, it was about a $15 million deferral into the second quarter\\nHow that plays out in the second quarter, weather as well as Easter timing plays into it, so some of that there in the first part of April, but the rest of it really can play into just as the weather hits in various spots, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast\\nSo I wouldn't say it's something that was immediate all in the first few weeks of April, it really plays more into the weather conditions in areas such as the North\\nI would say that we are seeing a little bit more of deflation than our original expectations\\nAnd we still believe that we're seeing signs that it would moderate in the back half of the year\\nSo, as we saw 50 basis points in Q1, I would say our expectation on deflation is more like a 20 basis points to 30 basis point impact for the year, with that being closer to the high end of that range in Q2 and moderating in the back half\\nSure, Alan I'll take those\\nFirst in regards to the e-commerce and the gross margin, we called out the growth in e-commerce and its impact on freight\\nSo, with our e-commerce business growing, it does have a higher freight rate and we've always had some level of burden, but e-commerce as small as it is, it's not had much of an impact, we are excited about the growth we have in the e-commerce business and we have seen a few basis points increase in the burden on the freight line within gross margin\\nSo, we called it out\\nI believe that we'll see that continue in the future quarters\\nAnd as our e-commerce business grows, it could have a 1 basis points or 2 basis points impact throughout the year on the gross margin rate\\nAnd then \\u2013 yeah, go ahead\\nIn regards to the oil patch, I'd first say that the Texas region like much of the South had less of an impact on weather\\nSo, we did not see as much volatility in sales in the Texas area, but specific to the oil patch, as Greg mentioned, we see it moderating and in the quarter we had a close to 30 basis point headwind against the \\u2013 30 basis points headwind on the comps due to the oil patch stores\",\n          \"And hello, everybody\\nAs Mitch mentioned, we\\u2019re off to a good start to the year\\nWe grew sales by 7% excluding currency and 4% on an organic basis\\nAnd we delivered an 18% increase in adjusted earnings per share, driven by strong operating performance and a lower tax rate\\nCurrency translation reduced reported sales by about 1% in the first quarter, with an approximately $0.03 negative impact to EPS\\nOur adjusted operating margin in the first quarter improved 40 basis points to 10.1%\\nThis was driven primarily by the margin expansion in RBIS\\nProductivity continues to be a key driver of the year-on-year margin improvement, including about $11 million of incremental savings from restructuring actions net of transition costs\\nOur adjusted tax rate was 30% in the quarter, reflecting our revised outlook for the full year rate, which is lower than prior year, due largely to geographic and income mix and the adoption of new accounting standards that impact the accounting for taxes on share-based compensation\\nWe now expect the impact of this accounting change to be approximately $0.14 for the year, roughly $0.07 higher than previously anticipated due to the rise in our share price during the quarter\\nFree cash flow was negative $22 million, which is $15 million better than Q1 of last year\\nHigher net income and improved operating working capital performance was partially offset by higher capital spend to support our growth strategy\\nWe continue to expect free cash flow conversion for the year of approximately 100% of GAAP net income\\nWe also repurchased approximately 500,000 shares in the quarter at an aggregate cost of $35 million and paid $36 million in dividends\\nIncluding dilution, the company\\u2019s share count increased by roughly 600,000 shares in the quarter, half of which relates to the tax accounting change\\nAdditionally, you may recall that dilution always has the biggest impact in the first quarter of our year\\nOverall, our balance sheet remains strong and we have ample capacity to invest in the business, as well as continue returning cash to shareholders in a disciplined manner\\nAs you know, in March, we issued \\u20ac500 million of 1.25% senior notes, which are due in 2025. We used approximately \\u20ac200 million of the proceeds to repay short-term borrowings associated with last year's acquisition of Mactac\\nThe remainder will be used primarily to support further investment in the business, including acquisitions\\nWe\\u2019re pleased with the results of this first euro offering, which is consistent with our large and growing footprint in Europe and provides us a natural hedge for our balance sheet\\nOn the acquisition front, we closed the previously announced Hanita Coatings deal in March and the integration of that business is underway\\nThe announced acquisition of Yongle Tape is on track to close in the middle of this year as well\\nBoth of these acquisitions will accelerate our ability to grow faster in higher-value categories\\nWe expect the impact to 2017 EPS to be immaterial for each of these transactions as we move through their integration phases\\nNow, let me turn to the segment results for the quarter\\nOur Label and Graphic Materials sales were up 9% excluding currency and up approximately 5% on an organic basis\\nThe solid organic growth continues to be led by the emerging markets and Western Europe\\nThe strength in emerging markets continues to be broad-based, with double-digit demand growth in the quarter\\nWe also had a modest benefit from pre-buy activity in China, ahead of our price increase that took effect in late March\\nWithin the mature markets, we continued mid-single digit growth in Western Europe and that was partially offset by some softness in North America, as Mitch indicated\\nOur high-value categories were up mid-single digits on an organic basis, with low single-digit growth in the combined graphics and reflective businesses, offset by some continued strength in specialty labels\\nThe slower growth in graphics was due mostly to timing of customer purchases as well as a challenging comparison in North America, where the category grew at a mid-teens rate in Q1 of 2016. LGM's operating margin of 12.7% was unchanged from last year as the benefit from higher volume and productivity was offset by unfavorable product mix and higher employee-related costs\\nThe year-over-year impact of price and raw material costs was negligible in the quarter, but we did see some modest sequential raw material inflation and we expect that trend to continue into the second quarter\\nAs I mentioned, we have raised prices in China\\nAnd if current inflationary pressures in other markets persist, we will look to raise prices again where appropriate\\nShifting now to Retail Branding and Information Solutions, RBIS continues to show good progress from our business transformation, with organic growth of 3% despite a lower contribution from RFID than we have seen in recent quarters\\nAnd we had continued meaningful improvement in our operating margin\\nIn the base apparel categories, we continue to see volume growth outpace apparel unit imports in what remains a challenging environment\\nIn addition, the impact of strategic price reductions to improve our competitiveness moderated in the first quarter\\nAs Mitch mentioned, the RFID was up mid-single digits for the quarter, in line with our expectations\\nWe continue to expect this business to deliver 20%-plus growth per year, with volatility in the growth rate from period to period\\nRBIS\\u2019 operating margin improvement reflected the benefits of productivity initiatives and higher volumes, which are partially offset by higher employee-related costs\\nAs the team continues to execute its business transformation, we anticipate continued margin expansion over the balance of the year\\nIn our Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment, our sales also came in better than anticipated, with growth of 4% excluding currency and an organic decline of approximately 1%\\nMid-single digit organic growth in industrial categories largely offset the expected decline in healthcare\\nOperating margin declined in this segment overall due to the sales decline in healthcare categories as well\\nLet me now turn to our outlook for the balance of the year\\nWe have raised the midpoint of guidance for adjusted earnings per share by $0.18 to an updated range of $4.50 to $4.65. Roughly $0.07 of this increase reflects the stronger operating outlook and another $0.07 comes from the higher-than-expected impact from the tax accounting change\\nThe remainder reflects the reduced headwind from currency translation, which is partially offset by modestly higher share count\\nWe now also expect the impact of restructuring charges and other one-time items to be approximately $0.30 for the full year, a $0.10 increase versus our previous assumption\\nThis reflects the shift in timing of certain charges associated with our restructuring actions and the inclusion of transaction costs from the Yongle Tape acquisition, which was not previously in our guidance\\nWe outline some of the key contributing factors to our EPS guidance on slide nine of the supplemental materials\\nI\\u2019ll focus on the factors that have changed from our previous outlook\\nWe now expect organic sales growth of 3.5% to 4.5% for the full year, reflecting our solid results in the first quarter\\nAt recent foreign exchange rates, we estimate that currency translation will reduce net sales by approximately 1% and reduce pretax earnings by roughly $10 million\\nAs discussed, we\\u2019re also expecting interest rate of approximately 30% for the full year\\nAnd we expect average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, of 89 million to 89.5 million shares\\nOur other key assumptions essentially remain unchanged from what we shared last quarter\\nSo, overall, to wrap up, we\\u2019re very pleased with the start to the year and our continued progress against our long-term strategic and financial objectives\\nSo, thank you and now we\\u2019ll open up the call for your questions\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nYeah\\nSo, it\\u2019s not actually higher share-based compensation\\nIt\\u2019s the tax impact on share-based compensation\\nSo, that was the change in the quarter\\nSo that\\u2019s related to an accounting standard change\\nSo, we have removed the impact of taxes on share-based compensation from an equity to the income statement\\nSo, that was really what the challenge was\\nIt\\u2019s not necessarily an increase in share-based compensation overall\\nYeah\\nReally, the impact of a smaller headwind on currency, given where we are right now versus where we were at the beginning of the year, net of a little bit of a headwind on the share count\\nIn terms of the cash tax, not a major change from where we\\u2019ve been historically at this point\\nThat accounting change also did have a small impact on our cash flow as well, but overall not a big change from a cash tax rate\\nI think on graphics in particular, we did have a little bit of low-single-digit growth in North America in the quarter\\nAnd that was coming off of Q1 of last year where we grew, I think, in the mid to high teens in the graphics business\\nIf you look at kind of a couple of year comp there, we\\u2019re still up in the mid-teens from where we were a couple of years ago in Q1. So, still feel good about our overall trajectory in graphics\\nJust a little bit of a blip in this quarter with the high growth we had a year ago\\nOverall, as Mitch I think mentioned in his comments, other volumes in North America were up slightly year-over-year, particularly in our base business, then offsetting part of that kind of slower growth rate in graphics\\nIt\\u2019s broadly the volume flow-through from what we\\u2019ve changed on the top line by and large\\nObviously, individual divisions, there's different things going on\\nBut that's one \\u2013 I\\u2019d say overall what\\u2019s happening\\nJeff, so I ought to take this one\\nWe issue equity-based compensation within the first quarter\\nAnd people who are retirement-eligible, that tends to have a disproportional hit at the point of grant on the P&L, not only necessarily vesting\\nSo, that\\u2019s one of the reasons that it hits in Q1 a little bit more than elsewhere\\nYeah\\nI think the gap is negligible in the first quarter\\nAs I said, we do expect some modest inflationary pressure sequentially into Q2. So, you might have a slightly bigger gap, but still relatively modest overall\\nAnd we\\u2019d expect it to narrow again in the second half\\nThank you, Jeff\\nI think we started to see some increases in China, in particular, a little bit earlier in acrylics, in particular, I think, earlier this year that let us to do the price increasing action in March\\nWe are starting to see the pressures in the back half of Q1 and into Q2, increased a little bit, as I said, in some of the other regions, and that's where we\\u2019re evaluating other actions\\nBut, again, also looking at how we look at productivity in material reengineering to help abate that as well\\nBut, overall, we\\u2019re seeing a little bit, again, modest increases across the regions, a little bit earlier in China, which is why we took the action there\\nAnd we\\u2019re evaluating actions in other areas\\nBut we do see some signs that this inflation could be a bit transitory across the year\\nso, we\\u2019re making sure we\\u2019re staying on top of that and we\\u2019ll increase prices as appropriate and where it\\u2019s necessary\\nWell, this being our largest business, the whole range of our guidance that we have, 3.5% to 4.5%, we came in at 5%\\nYou\\u2019re asking specifically about LGM\\nSo, at the low end, you\\u2019d have to have a moderation for the rest of the year\\nAnd at the high-end, you would basically have a consistency with what we saw on Q1.\\nThank you, George\\nSo, first, on the employee cost inflation, this business is more employee intensive than our other businesses, and that's why we call it out as far as the wage inflation that we have within the business\\nYou would expect \\u2013 I won\\u2019t comment specifically about in this year, but over the trend of the transformation that we have that that headwind would moderate a bit\\nThe key thing we focus on is our general wage inflation \\u2013 because we have this in all of our businesses \\u2013 getting it to a size where it\\u2019s at or less than our general productivity that we have\\nSo, non-restructuring productivity\\nSo, using Lean Sigma and otherwise\\nAnd that is our focus and that's something that we've achieved within the quarter and reached\\nAnd then, as far as our share gain opportunities, you asked about the \\u2013 we cycle through the strategic pricing adjustments, but talking about price going forward within this business is tough\\nIt\\u2019s a custom business, so you're moving from a 3 x 3 tag to a 3 x 2 tag and going from four color and five color and so forth\\nSo, what we really focus on are the variable margins within that\\nAnd we think that we can continue to maintain the variable margins and continue to drive more competitiveness and gain more share\\nAnd the share isn't just about price\\nA big move here has been our improved service, both preorder and our design capabilities, as well as post-order, so how quick we can deliver the products to our customers\\nThat is a key part of the value proposition that we\\u2019ve dramatically improved over the last 18 months\",\n          \"Good morning, everybody\\nI'm on slide 4 for those following the presentation online\\nAs Brian just said, we had a great first quarter\\nCable delivered terrific results, balancing strong financial growth with healthy customer metrics\\nAnd at NBCUniversal, we had phenomenal growth this quarter, with good contributions from all the business segments\\nSo on a consolidated basis, revenue increased 8.9%\\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 10.4%\\nAnd by the way, adjusted EBITDA is the new label for the metric we previously called operating cash flow\\nEarnings per share was $0.53, a 26.2% increase on an adjusted basis, and we generated $3.1 billion in free cash flow during the quarter\\nSo now let's start with Cable Communications on slide 5. Cable Communications delivered strong first quarter results\\nRevenue increased 5.8% to $12.9 billion\\nWe added 297,000 customer relationships, and we grew total revenue per customer relationship by 2.6%\\nBeginning this quarter, we are providing additional disclosure for residential and business customers, given the success of Business Services, which now annualizes at about $6 billion in revenue\\nNow for the numbers, starting with our Residential business, we added 263,000 net new relationships, an increase of 11% over last year, and ended the quarter with nearly 27 million relationships\\nContributing to these results were the positive benefits of customer retention with our Video and High-Speed Internet churn remaining at the lowest levels in over 10 years\\nCustomers continue to respond to our innovative X1 platform, our best-in-class high-speed data product, and the meaningful strides we have made in improving the customer experience\\nOur ability to bundle our products is also a key driver of customer retention, and we continue to do so successfully with 71% of our residential customers now subscribing to at least two products\\nIn terms of the individual Residential revenue categories, High-Speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth\\nRevenue increased 10.1% to $3.6 billion in the quarter, driven by an increase in our residential customer base and rate adjustments\\nBuilding on the strong performance in 2016, we added 429,000 total high-speed data customers in the quarter, with 397,000 of them being residential\\nWe've invested to provide a best-in-class broadband product as we have consistently increased the speeds we offer our customers, and we continue to invest to improve the Wi-Fi experience in and out of the home\\nWe ended the quarter with 54% of our residential customers taking speeds of 100 megabits per second or higher\\nLooking ahead, we believe we have a long runway for growth in adding broadband customers and a great roadmap to provide additional value to our existing customers\\nVideo revenue increased 4.3% to $5.8 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services and an increase in our residential customer base\\nOf our 42,000 total video customer net adds in the quarter, 32,000 were residential\\nX1 continues to move the needle on the customer experience, ARPU and retention, driving higher customer lifetime value\\nWe ended the quarter with 52% of our residential video customers having X1 compared to 35% a year ago, and we continue to expect our X1 penetration will be in the low 60% range by year-end\\nVoice revenue declined by 3.6% to $863 million in the first quarter, reflecting a modest decline in ARPU as well as the loss of 27,000 net residential customers\\nWe continue to believe that our voice product is a good value for our customers and an important part of our triple and quad play bundles\\nBusiness Services delivered another solid quarter of double-digit growth, as revenue increased 13.6% to $1.5 billion during the quarter\\nWe added 34,000 business customer relationships and grew revenue per business customer relationship by 5%\\nThe small business segment accounted for about 70% of our revenue and 60% of our growth, driven primarily by the net increase in customers\\nAnd our mid-size and enterprise segments continue to grow at higher rates, given the strength of our product set and the earlier stage of our efforts in these areas\\nCable Advertising revenue decreased 6.3% to $512 million in the quarter, reflecting lower political revenue compared to last year\\nExcluding the political contribution, our Cable Advertising revenue decreased 2.3%, reflecting a challenging advertising environment this quarter, particularly in discretionary categories\\nTurning to slide 6, first quarter Cable Communications EBITDA increased 6.3% to $5.2 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.3%, up 20 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016. This is a terrific financial performance as we manage through a period of higher programming costs by offsetting this impact with strong revenue growth and real discipline on non-programming operating expenses\\nProgramming expenses grew 11.7% during the quarter, reflecting the timing of contract renewals\\nBecause of these renewals, our programming expense growth should trend higher for the remainder of the year, consistent with our guidance at year-end\\nNon-programming expenses increased 1.4% for the quarter, helping preserve margins given the increase in programming expenses\\nAs we noted during our year-end call, this growth rate is trending lower than previous quarters as we benefit from our customer experience initiatives and overall disciplined cost management\\nNotably, Customer Service expenses declined 1.1% this quarter, even as we grew our customer relationships by 3.2%\\nConsistent with our objectives, we expect the rate of growth for our non-programming expenses to continue to trend lower this year compared to 2016. Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results\\nOn slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal's revenue increased 14.7% and EBITDA increased 24.4% in the quarter\\nThese strong results were driven by a successful box office, strong growth in retrans and affiliate fees, as well as the continued healthy performance at Theme Parks\\nCable Networks delivered strong growth this quarter, with revenue increasing 7.6% and EBITDA increasing 16.8% to $1.1 billion\\nThis EBITDA growth is higher than recent trends of low to mid-single-digit growth, and it was the result of two factors\\nFirst, distribution revenue increased 8.6%, due to the successful renewals of a number of our distribution agreements, and should continue to contribute to healthy EBITDA growth for the remainder of the year\\nSecond, content licensing revenue increased 54%, reflecting a new licensing agreement and is timing-related\\nPartially offsetting this growth was a 2.9% decline in Advertising revenue\\nBroadcast Television delivered another solid quarter with revenue growth of 5.9% and EBITDA growth of 13.4% to $322 million\\nThis growth was primarily driven by higher retransmission consent fees, which increased over 70% to $350 million and reflect the same contract renewals I just mentioned in Cable Networks\\nWe remain on track to reach $1.4 billion in retransmission revenue this year, a 65% increase over 2016 results\\nIn addition, Advertising revenue was stable compared to the first quarter of 2016, reflecting higher rates offset by audience rating declines and lower volume\\nPartially offsetting this quarter's EBITDA growth were higher programming and production costs\\nFilm revenue increased 43.2% and EBITDA increased 120.6% to $368 million\\nThese results primarily reflect higher theatrical revenue, which increased by $415 million to $651 million due to the strong performances of Fifty Shades Darker, Get Out and Split, as well as the continued success of Sing in the quarter\\nIn addition, Films' EBITDA growth reflects a positive contribution from DreamWorks, partially offset by higher programming and production costs\\nTheme Parks revenue increased 9% and EBITDA increased 6.1% to $397 million in the first quarter\\nThese results reflect higher attendance and higher per capita spending, despite an unfavorable comparison from the timing of spring break vacations\\nThe Easter holiday occurred in the first quarter last year but occurred during the second quarter this year, creating a challenging comparison this quarter\\nIf we adjust for this timing, EBITDA would have grown double digits this quarter\\nWe just opened the Jimmy Fallon attraction and we will be opening our third gate, the Volcano Bay water theme park, later this quarter\\nWe expect these new attractions to drive growth at the parks this year\\nLet's move to slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures\\nConsolidated capital expenditures increased 10.2% to $2.1 billion in the first quarter\\nAt Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 13% to $1.8 billion for the quarter, resulting in capital intensity of 13.8%\\nFor the full year, we continue to expect capital intensity to remain flat to 2016 at approximately 15% of total Cable Communications revenue\\nFor the quarter, the increase reflects a higher level of investment in customer premise equipment related to the deployment of the X1 platform and wireless gateways\\nHowever, the increase is timing-related and we continue to expect full-year CPE spending to decline\\nIn addition to our CPE investment this quarter, CapEx growth reflects a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity as well as increased investment in line extensions\\nAt NBCUniversal, first quarter capital expenditures decreased 3.3% to $285 million, reflecting an increased investment in Theme Parks, offset by lower spending at headquarters\\nFor the full year, we continue to expect NBCUniversal's capital investment plan to increase approximately 10%\\nAnd now finishing up on slide 9, as I mentioned earlier, we generated $3.1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter\\nIn terms of returning capital to shareholders, this quarter included: dividend payments totaling $657 million, up 7.5%; and share repurchases of $750 million\\nWe do continue to expect to repurchase $5 billion of our common shares this year\\nIn terms of leverage, we ended the quarter at 2.2 times net leverage\\nThis reflects investing activity this quarter, which primarily included a $500 million investment in Snap as part of its initial public offering, and the acquisition of Icontrol Networks\\nI would note that subsequent to the end of the quarter, we purchased the remaining 49% stake in Universal Studios Japan for $2.3 billion\\nRegarding the recently-announced results of the FCC's Broadcast Incentive Auction, as Jason said, it is still the quiet period, so we cannot discuss or answer any questions related to the auction or spectrum strategy today\\nHowever, based on facts disclosed by the FCC, I can confirm that, first, in the reverse auction, NBC sold spectrum in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago for expected total proceeds of $481.6 million\\nIn the forward auction, Comcast invested $1.7 billion to acquire spectrum in the markets identified in the FCC's Public Notice\\nThe average price Comcast paid per megahertz pop was $1.17. Hence, our net spectrum outlay is $1.27 billion\\nThese results confirm the comments we made prior to the auction\\nWe stated we would evaluate the opportunity and purchase spectrum only if we thought the price was right and if we thought the spectrum would have strategic value\\nThat concludes our summary of the quarter\\nI hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our results as well as our momentum for the rest of the year\\nNow, I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A\\nOn spectrum, we can't speak to the spectrum, other than to confirm what we did, which I did earlier\\nBut I'll just say we approached it the way we said we would before the auction started, and we're pleased with the outcome\\nSo it's Mike\\nJust on Cable margins, we gave guidance for the year that we'd be flat to down 50 basis points for the year, with programing costs continuing to be high this year and that we did expect to drive improvement in the rates on non-programming expenses\\nSo had a very good first quarter, but as far as going down the road on changing any guidance, we're not doing that\\nThat said, I'll hand it over to Dave to give some qualitative stuff of what he's doing because all that will really continue\\nAnd, Vijay, on capital returns, so the company's got a great track record of being very thoughtful about how we balance our needs to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders\\nSo we maintain a strong capital structure, as you know\\nAnd we think that's strategically important\\nWe like the idea of consistently increasing the return of capital to shareholders, but making sure that we keep the ability to allocate strategic capital to take advantage of opportunities when they arise\\nSo it's way too early on tax reform to say anything, other than we seemingly are positioned well to be a beneficiary of the various ways in which it might shake out\\nAnd once we have some final details, we'll take all that into consideration through the lens that we've always talked about, our balancing capital priorities\\nWell, Jonathan, it's Mike\\nThanks for the question\\nI mean, Dave covered earlier all of the things that are ongoing in the business, in terms of attacking non-programming expenses\\nAnd we've commented previously on where programming goes\\nSo the answer, as I said earlier, is we're not going to go beyond the guidance we already gave of margins for this year, but we'll keep working on optimizing the business for the long term and we'll be back to you early next year with our thoughts\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":24}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["earnings_call_dataset.info()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"70Lqz1EV8quY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1746296472344,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":47,"user":{"displayName":"Joe Wilbur","userId":"12998030036648390645"}},"outputId":"50822539-3c74-433e-e69a-341c833dbfb7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 572 entries, 0 to 571\n","Data columns (total 3 columns):\n"," #

We continued to execute on our restructuring plan which includes the closure and consolidation of more than 30 facilities\\nThese actions are important to achieving the flexible cost structure required to remain profitable through the cycles\\nAt the same time, we are thoughtfully preserving the capacity needed to meet future growth needs\\nAs a result of restructuring actions, we incurred $169 million in restructuring costs in the quarter, $30 million more than in the second quarter of 2016. In the quarter, we also recognized a pre-tax gain of $85 million on the sale of our investment in IronPlanet\\nAdjusted profit per share was up $0.40 from $1.09 in the second quarter of 2016 to $1.49. Higher sales, including a favorable mix, were the primary drivers of the profit improvement\\nImproved price on lower variable manufacturing costs were about offset by higher period cost due to an increase to the short-term incentive compensation accrual that resulted from the upward revision to the outlook\\nNow let's turn to slide five\\nSecond quarter operating profit was $1.251 billion as compared with $785 million in 2016, up $466 million\\nOperating profit pull-through in the quarter was nearly 50%\\nPositive changes to operating profit came from several areas\\nThe largest increase to profit was a result of higher sales volume and favorable mix\\nAll four geographic regions and all three primary product segments saw higher sales and revenues\\nHowever, increases to sales and revenues were largely concentrated in four end markets\\nChina construction and North America gas compression continued to experience strength, and robust overhaul and maintenance activity drove higher aftermarket parts sales for both mining and well servicing equipment\\nPrice improved $183 million in the quarter\\nThe favorable change was largely due to Construction Industries as Resource Industries and Energy and Transportation price realization were about flat\\nVariable manufacturing costs were favorable $44 million, largely due to the favorable impact of period cost absorbed as inventories increased in the quarter in many of our factories to support higher production\\nAs we ramp up production, we remain focused on lean principles, and we are working diligently to bring production up quickly but also efficiently\\nMaterial costs were about flat in the quarter\\nWhile our design and procurement teams continue to work on projects to lower material costs through redesign and resourcing, we expect higher steel cost to put pressure on material cost in the second half\\nSo while period costs were higher by $237 million, in the quarter we accrued about $330 million more short-term incentive compensation for ME&T than the second quarter of last year\\nWhen exclude the higher STIP accrual, period costs were lower by about $80 million driven by restructuring and cost reduction actions over the past year that are focused on lowering the company's embedded cost structure\\nAs we have weathered through the challenges of the last few years, maintaining a strong balance sheet has been a priority and we are continuing that focus\\nME&T operating cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and is $3.6 billion year-to-date, both well above prior year comparables\\nME&T debt-to-cap at the end of the quarter was 38.6%, well within our targeted range\\nWe ended the quarter with $10.2 billion in enterprise cash, and in June the board approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend which we expect will make 2017 the 24th year in a row of paying higher dividends to our shareholders\\nNow let's move on to discuss each of the segments, and we'll start with slide six\\nConstruction Industry sales were up 11% to $4.9 billion\\nHigher sales volume to Asia Pacific and Latin America and favorable price realization contributed to the increase\\nMost of the sales increase in the quarter for Construction Industries was driven by what has continued to be strong end user demand in China for construction equipment, most notably excavators\\nThrough the first half of the year, the 10 ton and above excavator industry in China was up about 130% from last year\\nStrength in China continues to be driven by government support for infrastructure and strong residential investment\\nSales in China in the second quarter were better than we had expected, and we now expect demand in China to remain strong through the rest of the year\\nIf you look at the chart at the top of the right-hand side of slide six, it shows China industry sales for 10 ton and above sized excavators from 2006 through 2017 forecast\\nYou can see from the chart that while demand for 10 ton and above excavators is up significantly versus the last two years, it is still far below highs achieved earlier this decade\\nContinued strength in China is dependent on underlying demand, government support and accommodating credit conditions For Latin America, sales were higher due to an increase in end user demand across several South American countries as well as favorable dealer inventory changes\\nWhile we saw some regions improve in the quarter, Latin America, especially Brazil, remained challenged, and sales are still at very low levels\\nNorth America sales to end users were up and price realization improved\\nHowever, these were mostly offset by a drop in dealer inventory\\nNorth America dealers typically pull from inventory in the second quarter to support the strong selling season\\nHowever, this year the reduction in dealer inventory drawdown was greater than last year, resulting in an unfavorable impact to sale\\nAs you can see in the chart on the bottom right-hand side of the slide, higher end user demand in North America was primarily driven by improved residential and non-residential construction\\nAs the chart also shows, infrastructure spend in the U.S\\nhas been stagnant for some time, and sales of construction equipment for infrastructure projects was down in the quarter as we have yet to see federal, state and local funding for road projects translate into higher sales\\nThe United States is in need of infrastructure investment\\nPassage of a federal infrastructure bill would be positive for our country and our business\\nAs expected, in the middle of the spring and summer selling season, the backlog for construction industries was down from the first quarter of 2017. However, the decrease this quarter of about $300 million was less than the first quarter to second quarter reductions in both 2015 and 2016 when the backlog went down by $1 billion and $900 million respectively\\nOrder rates were strong in the quarter with all regions seeing an improvement from year ago\\nLet's move to slide seven\\nConstruction Industries segment profit was favorable by about $350 million driven by favorable price realization and higher sales volume, including a favorable mix of products\\nPeriod costs were about flat as higher short-term incentive compensation expense was largely offset by restructuring and cost reduction actions\\nConstruction Industries was an early adopter of our operating and execution model, and this focus has helped to improve their segment profitability\\nSegment profit margin in the quarter was 18.2%, an increase of almost 600 basis points from the second quarter of last year\\nLet's move to slide eight and Resource Industries\\nContinued strong demand for after-market parts to support overhauls and maintenance work combined with favorable changes to dealer inventories were the primary drivers of the $300 million increase in sales and revenues for Resource Industries; an increase of 21%\\nIn order to call a recovery in mining, we have said that first the excess machine inventory in the mines would need to be worked off\\nThen demand for overhauls and maintenance would drive higher aftermarket part sales\\nAnd last, orders for new equipment would start to increase\\nThe cycle is starting to play out\\nUtilization on trucks is up 4% from last year\\nThe part fleet continues to come down, and for the fifth quarter in a row, part sales have increased to support rebuild and maintenance needs as well as higher utilization of fleets in the mines\\nAnd our order rates are improving\\nAfter four years of dealers reducing their inventories, for the second sequential quarter, dealer inventory held about flat\\nSales increases and favorable dealer inventory changes were broad based across all regions\\nAs you saw in the sales to user numbers that were released yesterday, RI sales to users were about flat in the quarter\\nHowever, we believe sales to users are a lagging indicator of industry trend\\nOrder rates in the quarter were up more than double the second quarter of last year\\nThe backlog for Resource Industries was up about $300 million from the end of the first quarter 2017, and Resource Industries was a significant part of the $3 billion increase in the backlog since the second quarter of last year\\nHowever, while Resource Industries has started to recover, sales volumes remain at historically low level\\nWe'll move to slide nine and look at their operating performance\\nOn improving sales with a focus on operational performance, Resource Industries delivered a solid quarter\\nSegment profit was $97 million, up $260 million from a loss of $163 million in 2016. The improvement in profit resulted from higher sales volume, including a favorable mix of products and lower period cost\\nResource Industries continues to implement a number of restructuring actions to lower their breakeven point\\nThese initiatives enabled them to deliver lower period cost in the quarter even after recognizing a large increase in short-term incentive compensation expense\\nResource Industries incurred additional warranty expense of a little over $50 million in the quarter for a customer program we do not expect to repeat\\nNext we'll go through Energy and Transportation on slide ten\\nSales were up $200 million or 5% in the quarter to $3.9 billion\\nHigher sales into oil and gas combined with higher industrial aftermarket sales were the primary drivers of the sales increase\\nSales into power generation were about flat as a slight improvement in North America was mostly offset by weaknesses in other regions\\nTransportation sales decreased, largely due to lower demand for marine application\\nSales into the rail industry were about flat\\nWhile the rail industry remains weak and the number of stored locomotives remains elevated, this was mostly offset in the quarter by an increase in rail services to support higher rail traffic\\nThe chart on the right side of slide 10 shows the four-year history of U.S\\nrig counts and west Texas intermediate oil prices\\nThe number of rigs in production has doubled from recent lows reached in May of 2016. U.S\\noil production has increased accordingly\\nIn the areas where we participate in the oil and gas market, the recent strength has largely been concentrated to well servicing and midstream gas compression applications\\nDemand for aftermarket parts to support overhaul and maintenance of well servicing fleets increased in the quarter, primarily to support rigs that are going back to work in the Permian Basin and other shale formations in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico where the cost of production and transportation is low enough to encourage investment despite recent oil price volatility\\nMidstream gas compression is having another good year as we support the continued buildout of North America's natural gas infrastructure\\nIn addition, recent developments in the Permian in the last 12 months have had a higher concentration of natural gas than previous wells\\nThis discovery has contributed to a higher demand for 3500 and 3600 reciprocating engines to support the midstream gas compression growth in that region\\nWe move to slide 11; we'll look at the segment for Energy and Transportation\\nEnergy and Transportation profit was up $98 million from $602 million to $700 million\\nThis was largely attributable to higher sales volume, a favorable impact from cost absorption and improved material cost\\nPeriod cost increased in the quarter but were about flat after excluding higher short term incentive compensation expense\\nBefore I move on to the outlook, a quick comment on financial products\\nOperating profit was down slightly due to the absence of the sale of securities at Cat Insurance Services\\nThe portfolio remains healthy with past dues down 22 basis points in the second quarter of 2016 and write-offs were down $7 million\\nUsed equipment prices continued to improve which helped, and the team delivered a solid quarter\\nWe'll move to slide 12, and we'll cover the outlook\\nWe announced this morning that we are raising the outlook for full year sales and revenues and profit per share\\nIn April we provided an outlook for sales and revenues of $38 billion to $41 billion\\nAs a result of strong operational performance in the first half, encouraging order rate, good economic indicators and a solid backlog, we are providing new guidance for sales and revenues in the range of $42 billion to $44 billion with a midpoint of $43 billion, up $3.5 billion from the prior outlook\\nAt the midpoint of the sales and revenues range, we have raised the profit per share outlook to $3.50 per share and raised the adjusted profit per share outlook from $3.75 to $5. We'll move on to slide 13 and cover the sales outlook by segment\\nWe now expect Construction Industries sales for the year to be up 10% to 15% versus the previous outlook of flat to up 5%\\nThis is driven largely by higher end user demand in both China and North America\\nOrder rates for Construction Industries have been strong through the first half of the year across most regions with an exception of the Middle East and Brazil which remain challenged\\nThe backlog is also up significantly from the second quarter of 2016. We do expect sales in the second half of the year to be slightly lower than the first half\\nFor Construction Industries, the second quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year as construction activity and deliveries pick up to support the spring and summer construction season in the Northern Hemisphere\\nFewer workdays due to holidays and vacations combined with the anticipation of colder weather typically drives sales lower in the second half\\nIn China, on average for the last five years, over 55% of sales were realized in the first half of the year\\nFor Resource Industries, we now expect sales to be up 20% to 25% for the full year versus the previous outlook of up 10% to 15%\\nWhile we expect aftermarket part sales to remain strong through the rest of the year as the number of parked trucks is reduced and the demand for overhauls declines, we expect the rate of growth to slow, and for part sales to be lower in the second half than the first\\nHowever, we expect this will be more than offset by an increase in new equipment sales\\nEnergy and Transportation sales are forecasted to be up 5% to 10% for the year versus the previous outlook of about flat\\nWe continue to see strong rebuild activity in well servicing for engines, transmission, pumps, and flow iron, and new equipment deliveries are expected to increase in the second half of the year\\nWe also expect shipments to North America gas compression customers to be higher in the second half\\nIndustrial, power generation and transportation are all expected to be about flat to slightly up\\nWe move to slide 14. At the midpoint of the sales and revenue range, the new outlook for profit per share is $3.50 and the revised outlook for adjusted profit per share is $5. The increase in the profit outlook since April is largely the result of the improved forecast for sales and revenues and disciplined cost control partially offset by an increase in short term incentive compensation expense\\nAs compared to 2016 at the midpoint of the range, the revised outlook reflects higher sales and revenues of about $4.5 billion or 12%, and an increase in adjusted profit per share of $1.58. The increase in adjusted profit per share versus 2016 is largely driven by higher sales volume of $4.5 billion and the associated margin on those sales\\nFavorable price, while we do not expect the same level of price favorability in the second half of the year, we still expect favorable price realization for the full year in a range of 0.5% to 1%\\nFavorable impact from period cost absorbed as inventories are expected to increase to support higher production level\\nThese favorable items will be partially offset by higher short term incentive compensation expense of about $1 billion\\nMaterial costs are now expected to be about flat for the full year\\nWhile geopolitical uncertainty and commodity volatility continue to be risks to the outlook, our outlook assumes that oil prices remain bound within the recent range of volatility, markets stay resilient to geopolitical uncertainties, and China remains supportive of growth\\nHowever, changes to any of these variables as well as others could impact our sales and revenues outlook for the full year\\nWe'll turn to slide 15 and wrap up\\nOperational performance for the year has been strong with second quarter operating profit pull-through of nearly 50%\\nWhile a number of our end markets remain challenged, we see strong demand in deliveries for China construction and North America gas compression equipment\\nAnd demand for aftermarket parts has increased to support overhaul and maintenance activity for well servicing, gas compression, and mining equipment\\nOrders and end user demand for North American construction equipment also improved in the quarter\\nWe continue to be focused on lean, product quality, and investing in the business for future growth\\nThe balance sheet remains strong, and we delivered $2 billion in ME&T operating cash flow in the quarter\\nGiven year to date performance and our confidence in the second half of the year, we are raising the outlook for both sales and revenues and profit per share\\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Amy\\nAnn, this is Brad Halverson\\nMaybe just another comment about how we use that language\\nWe use that language because that's how we're operating internally\\nWe have now been through four years of a downturn\\nIt's been hard on us\\nWe've taken significant restructuring activities and we like where our cost structure is at and where our balance sheet is at\\nAnd so using our operating and execution model, Jim is really driving continued focus on cost reduction across the support areas, and as we increase period cost, you'll see that there'll be very targeted in areas that offer the most long term value for the company consistent with kind of the pools of OPACC we see out there in the future\\nAnd this is a little example in the second half of this year where we're going to take an opportunity to do a little bit of that where we think there's a lot of value and keep the lid on the other costs that we have in the company\\nYeah, I'd say, Ann, actually I think not because this time I've been in a career here at Cat a long time\\nTypically, we have reductions in areas that are easy to find\\nSo we reduce R&D or reduce other things\\nIn this downturn, if you look at our cost reduction, it's been highly targeted to areas that are not kind of future value\\nThey're areas of efficiency and consolidation and support cost\\nWe have really increased spending in many of the growth areas\\nWe've protected R&D by and large, and we've protected things like digital spending\\nSo we've taken an entirely different approach in this downturn in terms of where we took cost out and what cost we protected\\nSo I would say it's different than we would have historically done\",\n          \"Good morning, everyone\\nLet me start with the headlines for the quarter\\nSales and earnings were down slightly, reflecting a challenging environment, as Tom just described, and comparison to strong results last year\\nWe delivered significant cost savings in the quarter, and we've increased our full year cost savings outlook\\nAnd finally, we're on track with our overall capital plan\\nNow let's take a look at the details, starting with sales\\nOur second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, that's down 1% year-on-year due to lower organic sales\\nTom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes\\nOn profitability, second quarter gross margin was 36.1%, that's down 20 basis points year-on-year\\nOperating margin was 17.5%, down 50 basis points\\nWhile margins were down slightly overall, I'm encouraged with the improvements that we achieved in our Personal Care and K-C Professional business segments, and also in the developing and emerging markets overall\\nCommodities were a $75 million drag in the second quarter, and for the full year, we're now expecting inflation of $200 million to $300 million, that's $50 million higher than our previous estimate driven by higher pulp costs\\nOur teams continued to deliver significant FORCE cost savings\\nSecond quarter savings were $120 million and we've increased our full year savings target to $425 million to $450 million\\nOur original target was for savings of at least $400 million\\nGiven the current environment, we are also tightly managing our overhead spending\\nOn the bottom line, second quarter earnings per share were $1.49, down 3% year-on-year\\nLower equity income reduced earnings by $0.03 per share, offset by a lower share count and a slightly better effective tax rate\\nNow let's take a look at cash flow\\nCash provided by operations in the second quarter was $825 million, in line with our expectations\\nCash flow was down compared to $860 million in the year-ago quarter, including the impact of higher tax payments this year\\nSecond quarter working capital cash conversion cycle was down six days compared to full year 2016, bringing the year-to-date decline to five days\\nWe're making very good progress in this area, and we expect to nicely exceed our original one-day improvement target for the full year\\nWe also continue to manage capital spending in this environment, and we now expect that full year spending will be in the lower half of our $850 million to $950 million target range\\nOn capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $600 million\\nWe continue to expect that full year dividends and share repurchases will total between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion\\nLooking at our segments, in Personal Care, organic sales fell 1% due to lower net selling prices\\nOrganic sales were up 2% in developing and emerging markets but were down elsewhere\\nPersonal Care operating margins were 20.6%, up 60 basis points\\nThe improvement was driven by cost savings, partially offset by lower selling prices and higher input costs\\nIn Consumer Tissue, organic sales were down 2%, driven by North America\\nOverall, Consumer Tissue operating margins were 16.5%, down 190 basis points\\nThe results were impacted by lower sales and higher pulp costs\\nIn K-C Professional, organic sales in the quarter were up 1%, with gains in all major geographies\\nK-C Professional operating margins were 20.1%, up 150 basis points\\nThe comparison included benefits from cost savings\\nSo in summary, our second quarter results were impacted by difficult environment with weaker economies, category softness and increased competitive activity\\nNonetheless, we are achieving strong cost savings, we're generating healthy cash flow, and we're allocating capital in shareholder-friendly ways\\nI'll now turn the call back over to Tom\\nYeah, we do continue to deliver significant cost savings through the FORCE program, and we were able to take up the full year target\\nAnd what I'd say is that as the program name implies, our teams really are Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere\\nWhen you look at our supply chain savings that includes improving productivity and waste across our manufacturing operations, driving down the cost of our facilities, optimizing the cost of our product specifications and continually negotiating lower input costs or material costs of our products\\nAnd year-to-date, we are at 4% of cost of goods, which is really a strong performance, not only internally but benchmarks very well\\nI continue to see opportunities for us to continue to deliver the FORCE cost savings as we move forward\\nSo good performance there, and I think more opportunity there\\nSure\\nOn the buyback, the $800 million to $1 billion is still the right number for the year\\nWe're on track with that\\nAnd in terms of the interest expense, we did some pre-funding on the $950 million that comes due in August, which is why you see a higher debt number at the end of the quarter, but that should normalize\\nAnd the debt that we'll take out in August is a pretty high coupon, it's 6.125%, and so that will be replaced with lower interest rate debt and that should bring the interest expense down for the year\",\n          \"Thanks, Rob\\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Walmart's investor relations call to discuss third quarter earnings\\nThis is Steve Schmitt, and I'm joined today by, Kary Brunner, Michael Brigance, Joey Smith, and Miguel Garcia from the IR team\\nHopefully, you've seen our materials we issued this morning\\nI'm going to hit on a couple of key points in a minute, and then we'll open the call for Q&A\\nThere will be forward-looking statements on today's call, which are subject to future events and uncertainties\\nActual results could differ materially from these statements\\nPlease review the full Safe Harbor statement accompanying our earnings materials\\nSo let me talk about a few highlights in the quarter\\nWe had a really strong quarter\\nWe have broad-based growth\\nOn a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales were up 3.8%, an increase of $4.5 billion\\nWe delivered adjusted EPS of $1. You notice our GAAP EPS was $0.58 a share\\nSo we adjusted GAAP EPS for three items that are detailed in the release, I'll hit on the three of them\\nWe recently completed a debt tender offer\\nWe made an FCPA accrual regarding possible resolution of the FCPA matter\\nWe made the exit of certain properties in one of our international markets\\nSo excluding these items, our adjusted EPS was $1. We have good momentum in sales growth across the business\\ncomp sales growth was 2.7%, with comp traffic up 1.5%\\nWe saw about a 30 to 50 point positive impact to the comp from recent hurricanes\\nOur Walmart U.S\\neCommerce sales grew 50%\\nSam's comp sales grew 2.8% led by traffic and also had a benefit from the hurricanes\\nInternational delivered another solid quarter with 10 of 11 markets reporting positive comp sales\\nExcluding the charge for the FCPA accrual we disclosed today, we would have leveraged expenses as a company in the quarter, which has been a point of emphasis for us\\nWe're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.38 to $4.46, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $4.30 to $4.40. Fourth quarter Walmart U.S\\ncomp sales are expected to increase between 1.5% and 2% on more difficult compares\\nJust a couple of reminders\\nWe'll release our fourth quarter earnings on February 20, 2018. And like to let everyone know that next year's earnings release dates will be posted to our website\\nSo please mark your calendars for that\\nAnd at this point, we'd be happy to take your questions\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nThanks, Michael\\nLet me talk about maybe two things; gross margin on a consolidated basis, and then on a U.S\\nbasis\\nSo on a consolidated basis, gross profit rate declined 29 basis points\\nAnd you hit on several of the items, so on a consolidated basis, we have price investments in certain markets, mix effects of eCommerce, which you mentioned, and keep in mind the U.S\\nhurricane-related expenses that we had\\nI'd also like to point your attention to operating margin and some of the things that just we'd like you to pay attention to, as we called out some items such as the FCPA accrual, international impairments, and hurricane impacts\\nSo just keep these in mind when you're looking at overall operating profit performance in the quarter\\nFor Walmart U.S\\nspecifically, gross profit margin declined 36 basis points in the quarter\\nPrice investments, as you mentioned, mix effects of eCommerce impacted as well\\nAnd the hurricane specifically, we estimate impacted the gross profit decline of about a third of that\\nSo I'm not getting into all the details specifically, we continue to invest in price\\nWe're operating with more discipline, and we'll continue to look ways to manage our margin, and ways that work for our customers and work for our shareholders\\nIt's really the productivity beginning to turn for us\\nSo you could see gross profit margin pressure from time-to-time, and we need to get more disciplined with expenses\\nSo if you think about our business, and certainly our DNA, we're about offering everyday low prices, both in-store and online\\nThe fact is, some products are just cheaper to sell in stores, think about items like bottled water, so you'll see some price differences from time-to-time\\nThanks, Oliver\\nSo the first question around smart cart technology\\nIt's something that we continue to look at\\nWe need to be thoughtful about it as we think about putting that potentially on Walmart\\ncom, but nothing really more to add at this time\\nIn terms of the Lord & Taylor relationship, it's going to be a unique experience\\nThink about it as a flagship store\\nThis is expected to launch in the spring\\nIt will be dedicated store on Walmart\\nWe're excited about the relationship, the deep relationships Lord & Taylor has with great brands, and we know our customers look for premium brands on our site\\nSo we think it's a good agreement, and we look forward to the spring\\nWell, I think there's a lot of things\\nIf you talk to Greg Foran, the CEO of our U.S\\nbusiness, he could probably list a list of 20 to 30, maybe even more than that, from the time the customer walks in the door to the time they check out, from a booking standpoint\\nSo, we continue to look at it\\nI think you can tell in our results, the customers like the changes that we're making in our stores, and we'll continue to look to make a better experience so they continue shopping with us\\nWe continue to make progress on inventory\\nYou've seen more incremental improvements versus, I'd say, the step change improvements we saw last year, and we'll continue to look for improvements we can make in the business\\nI think it's a fair way to look at it, Simeon\\nWell, if you think about Jet, and thanks for bringing that up\\nJet was in the comp for a month, the way our comp calculations work\\nSo there really wasn't much of an impact in the third quarter results\\nReally the way we think about eCommerce is really in total\\nJet is a piece of our eCommerce business overall\\nWe made the decision earlier this year to give more transparency on our U.S\\neCommerce business, and we furthered that in our October meeting, so we'll continue to report on the eCommerce business as a whole\\nIn terms of a glide path, we feel good about the direction of our eCommerce business\\nI think this quarter is another good example of that and we will report that as we go\\nBut in terms of any glide path or volatility, we'll wait and see\\nThank you\\nMaybe I'll give a few comments and turn it over to Kary to give a little more detail\\nSo we'll take the inflation piece first\\nSo the way we've reported inflation on food is really excluding the price investment that we've made and as we got into this quarter we think it's a very \\u2013 it's \\u2013 you talked about what Brett said in his remarks, which is in a similar range or below what we reported which was 30 basis points of inflation in the past quarter\\nThe fact is it's getting a little bit more difficult for us to really be precise with that number as we look at our price investment markets\\nAs we anniversary some of those price investments, it's just becoming a little bit more difficult, so we'll give you as directional as a number as we can to help you analyze that business going forward\\nIn terms of the grocery business or the food business overall specifically, you mentioned online grocery pick up\\nWe know that that's working for our customers\\nWe continue to expand it\\nWe're in 1,100 locations now and expect to add another 1,000 next year\\nSo that's a big initiative for us\\nIt's working and our customers love it\\nIn terms of other things that are working, it's, again, it's a lot of different things\\nIt's expanding assortment, it's quality of product, having in-stocks and price is a component of it as well\\nKary, anything else you want to add?\\nWe won't give the specifics of that\\nIt's working for us based on our rollout plans\\nThanks, Robby\\nAnd I appreciate it\\nSo I think we have to manage labor costs like we manage other expenses in our business\\nOne of the big initiatives that we have is, as we grow the business we want to be more disciplined with our costs\\nWe need to be more efficient\\nWe talked about some of the technology enablers that are helping with that\\nWe have to manage labor costs and we have to look to do that in the most efficient way we can to reach the margin objectives that we have\\nSo that's what we continue to do\\nI think you think about freight just like the other variables that we manage in the business\\nWe have a lot of experience managing the P&L and whether it's labor or freight, we have to pull different levers to deliver on the objective that we have in the freight would be no exception\\nBut I don't have any specifics for you in terms of freight cost increasing\\nRob, next question please?\\nWell, you mentioned the sales piece of it which certainly helped\\nBut it's really about becoming more disciplined with our expenses overall\\nI know we had been talking about that for a while now and it's a big objective of ours going forward\\nThere's not one thing, it's just about being more efficient with the business overall\\nIt's great that we started to see that in the third quarter\\nWe've talked about our goals next year to leverage expenses and we'll continue to push towards that\\nBut it's not one thing, it's a lot\\nThanks, Karen\\nRob, next question please?\\nThanks for your question\\nSo, we continue to execute our pricing strategy that we laid out, I guess, two years ago now\\nThe details of that, and you're not going to be surprised to hear me say that, that we keep pretty close to the vest\\nSo pricing is a piece of what we're doing, along with customer experience and all the other initiatives that we have to grow the top line\\nSo we're not going to give specific details of pricing, but we continue to execute the strategy, and our customers are responding\\nWell, if you think about the Walmart customer base overall, it's actually a pretty good mirror image of the U.S\\npopulation in general\\nWe're pleased with how new customers are using us in multiple ways, and really an omni experience we laid out in our October meeting, that the omni customer certainly spends more with us than single channel customers\\nSo we continue to push that forward\\nIn terms of different age groups or whatnot that are adopting at a faster order, we don't have that particular information\\nBut we continue to move customers into the omni experience at Walmart, to use our brands in different ways\\nWe're expanding our online grocery pick up, almost doubling it next year\\nWe'll continue to do that, because we know that that's where the customer wants to use us in multiple channels, and we'll continue to forge ahead with that\\nWe do quite a bit of research as you would expect, Chuck\\nSo there's a lot of scientific data that we get, now I won't give you a scientific answer\\nThe real \\u2013 I think the nuts and bolts of it is that we think the customers reasonably, I mean, is doing reasonably well\\nWe haven't seen a marked change over the last several quarters, certainly in our results we continue to, I mean, this quarter is a good indication that our initiatives are appealing to the customer, but we don't see a marked change in customers right now\\nThat's really a different product mix and more than anything\\nIn terms of the associate delivery test, we continue to learn from what we're doing\\nIt's certainly an initiative that leverages the unique assets that we have\\nBut not only associate delivery, but ground-based platforms to solve for last mile for really quick delivery for our customers\\nSo we continue to watch that and learn from it\\nAnd nothing you can tell from our fourth quarter guidance of 1.5% to 2% that we feel pretty good about the momentum we have\\nMaybe I'll take the second part of your question first Paul\\nIn terms of the hurricane piece, I think we're as specific as we can be with what we laid out in the quarter with the Walmart U.S\\nbusiness, the 30 to 50 point comp benefit\\nSam's I think was 70 to 90 basis points\\nWe talked about the net of sales and increased cost, gross margin and SG&A to be about $150 million headwind for the U.S\\nbusiness and about $20 million for Sam's\\nSo I think we probably gave as much information as we could from that standpoint\\nIn terms of Sam's overall, I think in the comp piece of it, what I'd point you to more than anything is strong traffic\\nSo a 3.6% member traffic growth\\nWe have members coming in more frequently\\nWe have initiatives like Scan and Go that make it easier for members to come in and shop at clubs\\nAnd that's what I would point you to is traffic up 3.6% in the quarter\\nMatt, it's really the same factors that have driven health and wellness and relatively consistent performance\\nThere was a pick up this quarter as we continue to see script growth in our pharmacy, traffic is very healthy and we also have some new items in over-the-counter that are doing well and some of that obviously is driven by sickness so Cold, Cough & Flu (26:44) was strong this quarter, but branded drug inflation as well is a fact there, but really kind of the same factors that you've heard us talk about over the last couple of quarters, just a bit of a pickup in traffic this quarter\\nI mean, we did see some higher dollar purchases from the GM side\\nSee from a geography standpoint it's SG&A, SG&A overall\\nAnd one thing to point out on the FCPA is, it did drive the quarterly tax rate up\\nSo if you're looking at the year-over-year tax rate, the majority of it was driven by that particular accrual\\nI think the key is to be flexible\\nIf you look at some of the partnerships we've had around the business, I'd point you to JD initially in China, to partner with really one of the largest eCommerce platforms in China, that's where a partnership makes sense\\nYou have brands that we acquired, like Bonobos specifically, that give us really the unique access to great brands like Bonobos that we can leverage to be (29:14) proprietary to our platforms\\nAnd then you have things like Lord & Taylor that you can partner, a capital-light way to bring great brands to your site that we think would work for both parties\\nSo I think the key is to be flexible, and we'll continue to be flexible as we look to build our assortment and give customers more options\\nI think it's tough to dissect and I don't have any, I don't think, useful information, particularly on ladies apparel\\nBut, look, when you have a business of our scale that's growing like we did in the third quarter, I think you're taking share\\nIt's hard to dissect on who from\\nSo I don't really have any color on any specifics on that for you\\nBut thanks for your question, Kate\\nThanks for the question\\nI think it's TBD\\nI think we'll continue to test, learn, and move forward\\nWe have a lot of initiatives underway\\nA lot of you that came to Bentonville last month saw a lot of them, there were things that we're doing in-store that we're excited about\\nSo I think you'll see us test, take some swings, see what works, and expand and fail fast on some initiatives too\\nWe certainly take a look at the competitive environment, that's something we've done at Walmart for a long time\\nSo we continue to do that\\nOur brand is about everyday low prices on baskets of goods, that's where the customers trust our brands for and (32:12) we'll continue to make sure we do that\\nBigger baskets was a piece of it, Scot\\nIt's over 70 million\\nIn the last summer, we gave, I think it was 67 million\\nSo we continue to make progress\\nThank you\\nThanks for your question, Joe\\nAnd we appreciate you notice in the KitchenAid's part of our assortment now and you may have seen that we also have Bose, which is \\u2013 it's a great brand that now is associated with us\\nSo, you worry about that, I think you always watch and learn and we look at the data\\nWe analyze the data really well\\nWe know that customers are looking for premium brands on our website\\nWe think it helps the brand overall\\nSo we'll watch brands like that\\nWe're happy to have them as part of our assortment and we'll continue to learn\\nI think pricing is a piece of it\\nBut I think over the last, call it, at least 12 months maybe closer to 18 months now, there's been an increased focus on getting back to the basics, giving the customer a better experience and we're starting to see some green shoots there\\nThanks, guys\\nWe don't have any more questions in the queue\\nSo I just wanted to thank everyone for their time, for your interest in Walmart and happy holidays\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Stock_Ticker\",\n

Before I walk through the announcements for the quarter and the revised outlook, let's turn to slide four, and I will walk quickly through the headline numbers\\nSales and revenues of $11.3 billion were up about 10% from the second quarter of last year\\nWhile many of our end markets are far off previous peaks, we are starting to see several markets recover, and demand for China construction and North America gas compressions remain strong\\nSales were higher in all three primary product segments, led by Construction Industries, followed by Resource Industries, and then Energy and Transportation\\nProfit per share was up $0.42 from $0.93 to $1.35. We continued to execute on our restructuring plan which includes the closure and consolidation of more than 30 facilities\\nThese actions are important to achieving the flexible cost structure required to remain profitable through the cycles\\nAt the same time, we are thoughtfully preserving the capacity needed to meet future growth needs\\nAs a result of restructuring actions, we incurred $169 million in restructuring costs in the quarter, $30 million more than in the second quarter of 2016. In the quarter, we also recognized a pre-tax gain of $85 million on the sale of our investment in IronPlanet\\nAdjusted profit per share was up $0.40 from $1.09 in the second quarter of 2016 to $1.49. Higher sales, including a favorable mix, were the primary drivers of the profit improvement\\nImproved price on lower variable manufacturing costs were about offset by higher period cost due to an increase to the short-term incentive compensation accrual that resulted from the upward revision to the outlook\\nNow let's turn to slide five\\nSecond quarter operating profit was $1.251 billion as compared with $785 million in 2016, up $466 million\\nOperating profit pull-through in the quarter was nearly 50%\\nPositive changes to operating profit came from several areas\\nThe largest increase to profit was a result of higher sales volume and favorable mix\\nAll four geographic regions and all three primary product segments saw higher sales and revenues\\nHowever, increases to sales and revenues were largely concentrated in four end markets\\nChina construction and North America gas compression continued to experience strength, and robust overhaul and maintenance activity drove higher aftermarket parts sales for both mining and well servicing equipment\\nPrice improved $183 million in the quarter\\nThe favorable change was largely due to Construction Industries as Resource Industries and Energy and Transportation price realization were about flat\\nVariable manufacturing costs were favorable $44 million, largely due to the favorable impact of period cost absorbed as inventories increased in the quarter in many of our factories to support higher production\\nAs we ramp up production, we remain focused on lean principles, and we are working diligently to bring production up quickly but also efficiently\\nMaterial costs were about flat in the quarter\\nWhile our design and procurement teams continue to work on projects to lower material costs through redesign and resourcing, we expect higher steel cost to put pressure on material cost in the second half\\nSo while period costs were higher by $237 million, in the quarter we accrued about $330 million more short-term incentive compensation for ME&T than the second quarter of last year\\nWhen exclude the higher STIP accrual, period costs were lower by about $80 million driven by restructuring and cost reduction actions over the past year that are focused on lowering the company's embedded cost structure\\nAs we have weathered through the challenges of the last few years, maintaining a strong balance sheet has been a priority and we are continuing that focus\\nME&T operating cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and is $3.6 billion year-to-date, both well above prior year comparables\\nME&T debt-to-cap at the end of the quarter was 38.6%, well within our targeted range\\nWe ended the quarter with $10.2 billion in enterprise cash, and in June the board approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend which we expect will make 2017 the 24th year in a row of paying higher dividends to our shareholders\\nNow let's move on to discuss each of the segments, and we'll start with slide six\\nConstruction Industry sales were up 11% to $4.9 billion\\nHigher sales volume to Asia Pacific and Latin America and favorable price realization contributed to the increase\\nMost of the sales increase in the quarter for Construction Industries was driven by what has continued to be strong end user demand in China for construction equipment, most notably excavators\\nThrough the first half of the year, the 10 ton and above excavator industry in China was up about 130% from last year\\nStrength in China continues to be driven by government support for infrastructure and strong residential investment\\nSales in China in the second quarter were better than we had expected, and we now expect demand in China to remain strong through the rest of the year\\nIf you look at the chart at the top of the right-hand side of slide six, it shows China industry sales for 10 ton and above sized excavators from 2006 through 2017 forecast\\nYou can see from the chart that while demand for 10 ton and above excavators is up significantly versus the last two years, it is still far below highs achieved earlier this decade\\nContinued strength in China is dependent on underlying demand, government support and accommodating credit conditions For Latin America, sales were higher due to an increase in end user demand across several South American countries as well as favorable dealer inventory changes\\nWhile we saw some regions improve in the quarter, Latin America, especially Brazil, remained challenged, and sales are still at very low levels\\nNorth America sales to end users were up and price realization improved\\nHowever, these were mostly offset by a drop in dealer inventory\\nNorth America dealers typically pull from inventory in the second quarter to support the strong selling season\\nHowever, this year the reduction in dealer inventory drawdown was greater than last year, resulting in an unfavorable impact to sale\\nAs you can see in the chart on the bottom right-hand side of the slide, higher end user demand in North America was primarily driven by improved residential and non-residential construction\\nAs the chart also shows, infrastructure spend in the U.S\\nhas been stagnant for some time, and sales of construction equipment for infrastructure projects was down in the quarter as we have yet to see federal, state and local funding for road projects translate into higher sales\\nThe United States is in need of infrastructure investment\\nPassage of a federal infrastructure bill would be positive for our country and our business\\nAs expected, in the middle of the spring and summer selling season, the backlog for construction industries was down from the first quarter of 2017. However, the decrease this quarter of about $300 million was less than the first quarter to second quarter reductions in both 2015 and 2016 when the backlog went down by $1 billion and $900 million respectively\\nOrder rates were strong in the quarter with all regions seeing an improvement from year ago\\nLet's move to slide seven\\nConstruction Industries segment profit was favorable by about $350 million driven by favorable price realization and higher sales volume, including a favorable mix of products\\nPeriod costs were about flat as higher short-term incentive compensation expense was largely offset by restructuring and cost reduction actions\\nConstruction Industries was an early adopter of our operating and execution model, and this focus has helped to improve their segment profitability\\nSegment profit margin in the quarter was 18.2%, an increase of almost 600 basis points from the second quarter of last year\\nLet's move to slide eight and Resource Industries\\nContinued strong demand for after-market parts to support overhauls and maintenance work combined with favorable changes to dealer inventories were the primary drivers of the $300 million increase in sales and revenues for Resource Industries; an increase of 21%\\nIn order to call a recovery in mining, we have said that first the excess machine inventory in the mines would need to be worked off\\nThen demand for overhauls and maintenance would drive higher aftermarket part sales\\nAnd last, orders for new equipment would start to increase\\nThe cycle is starting to play out\\nUtilization on trucks is up 4% from last year\\nThe part fleet continues to come down, and for the fifth quarter in a row, part sales have increased to support rebuild and maintenance needs as well as higher utilization of fleets in the mines\\nAnd our order rates are improving\\nAfter four years of dealers reducing their inventories, for the second sequential quarter, dealer inventory held about flat\\nSales increases and favorable dealer inventory changes were broad based across all regions\\nAs you saw in the sales to user numbers that were released yesterday, RI sales to users were about flat in the quarter\\nHowever, we believe sales to users are a lagging indicator of industry trend\\nOrder rates in the quarter were up more than double the second quarter of last year\\nThe backlog for Resource Industries was up about $300 million from the end of the first quarter 2017, and Resource Industries was a significant part of the $3 billion increase in the backlog since the second quarter of last year\\nHowever, while Resource Industries has started to recover, sales volumes remain at historically low level\\nWe'll move to slide nine and look at their operating performance\\nOn improving sales with a focus on operational performance, Resource Industries delivered a solid quarter\\nSegment profit was $97 million, up $260 million from a loss of $163 million in 2016. The improvement in profit resulted from higher sales volume, including a favorable mix of products and lower period cost\\nResource Industries continues to implement a number of restructuring actions to lower their breakeven point\\nThese initiatives enabled them to deliver lower period cost in the quarter even after recognizing a large increase in short-term incentive compensation expense\\nResource Industries incurred additional warranty expense of a little over $50 million in the quarter for a customer program we do not expect to repeat\\nNext we'll go through Energy and Transportation on slide ten\\nSales were up $200 million or 5% in the quarter to $3.9 billion\\nHigher sales into oil and gas combined with higher industrial aftermarket sales were the primary drivers of the sales increase\\nSales into power generation were about flat as a slight improvement in North America was mostly offset by weaknesses in other regions\\nTransportation sales decreased, largely due to lower demand for marine application\\nSales into the rail industry were about flat\\nWhile the rail industry remains weak and the number of stored locomotives remains elevated, this was mostly offset in the quarter by an increase in rail services to support higher rail traffic\\nThe chart on the right side of slide 10 shows the four-year history of U.S\\nrig counts and west Texas intermediate oil prices\\nThe number of rigs in production has doubled from recent lows reached in May of 2016. U.S\\noil production has increased accordingly\\nIn the areas where we participate in the oil and gas market, the recent strength has largely been concentrated to well servicing and midstream gas compression applications\\nDemand for aftermarket parts to support overhaul and maintenance of well servicing fleets increased in the quarter, primarily to support rigs that are going back to work in the Permian Basin and other shale formations in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico where the cost of production and transportation is low enough to encourage investment despite recent oil price volatility\\nMidstream gas compression is having another good year as we support the continued buildout of North America's natural gas infrastructure\\nIn addition, recent developments in the Permian in the last 12 months have had a higher concentration of natural gas than previous wells\\nThis discovery has contributed to a higher demand for 3500 and 3600 reciprocating engines to support the midstream gas compression growth in that region\\nWe move to slide 11; we'll look at the segment for Energy and Transportation\\nEnergy and Transportation profit was up $98 million from $602 million to $700 million\\nThis was largely attributable to higher sales volume, a favorable impact from cost absorption and improved material cost\\nPeriod cost increased in the quarter but were about flat after excluding higher short term incentive compensation expense\\nBefore I move on to the outlook, a quick comment on financial products\\nOperating profit was down slightly due to the absence of the sale of securities at Cat Insurance Services\\nThe portfolio remains healthy with past dues down 22 basis points in the second quarter of 2016 and write-offs were down $7 million\\nUsed equipment prices continued to improve which helped, and the team delivered a solid quarter\\nWe'll move to slide 12, and we'll cover the outlook\\nWe announced this morning that we are raising the outlook for full year sales and revenues and profit per share\\nIn April we provided an outlook for sales and revenues of $38 billion to $41 billion\\nAs a result of strong operational performance in the first half, encouraging order rate, good economic indicators and a solid backlog, we are providing new guidance for sales and revenues in the range of $42 billion to $44 billion with a midpoint of $43 billion, up $3.5 billion from the prior outlook\\nAt the midpoint of the sales and revenues range, we have raised the profit per share outlook to $3.50 per share and raised the adjusted profit per share outlook from $3.75 to $5. We'll move on to slide 13 and cover the sales outlook by segment\\nWe now expect Construction Industries sales for the year to be up 10% to 15% versus the previous outlook of flat to up 5%\\nThis is driven largely by higher end user demand in both China and North America\\nOrder rates for Construction Industries have been strong through the first half of the year across most regions with an exception of the Middle East and Brazil which remain challenged\\nThe backlog is also up significantly from the second quarter of 2016. We do expect sales in the second half of the year to be slightly lower than the first half\\nFor Construction Industries, the second quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year as construction activity and deliveries pick up to support the spring and summer construction season in the Northern Hemisphere\\nFewer workdays due to holidays and vacations combined with the anticipation of colder weather typically drives sales lower in the second half\\nIn China, on average for the last five years, over 55% of sales were realized in the first half of the year\\nFor Resource Industries, we now expect sales to be up 20% to 25% for the full year versus the previous outlook of up 10% to 15%\\nWhile we expect aftermarket part sales to remain strong through the rest of the year as the number of parked trucks is reduced and the demand for overhauls declines, we expect the rate of growth to slow, and for part sales to be lower in the second half than the first\\nHowever, we expect this will be more than offset by an increase in new equipment sales\\nEnergy and Transportation sales are forecasted to be up 5% to 10% for the year versus the previous outlook of about flat\\nWe continue to see strong rebuild activity in well servicing for engines, transmission, pumps, and flow iron, and new equipment deliveries are expected to increase in the second half of the year\\nWe also expect shipments to North America gas compression customers to be higher in the second half\\nIndustrial, power generation and transportation are all expected to be about flat to slightly up\\nWe move to slide 14. At the midpoint of the sales and revenue range, the new outlook for profit per share is $3.50 and the revised outlook for adjusted profit per share is $5. The increase in the profit outlook since April is largely the result of the improved forecast for sales and revenues and disciplined cost control partially offset by an increase in short term incentive compensation expense\\nAs compared to 2016 at the midpoint of the range, the revised outlook reflects higher sales and revenues of about $4.5 billion or 12%, and an increase in adjusted profit per share of $1.58. The increase in adjusted profit per share versus 2016 is largely driven by higher sales volume of $4.5 billion and the associated margin on those sales\\nFavorable price, while we do not expect the same level of price favorability in the second half of the year, we still expect favorable price realization for the full year in a range of 0.5% to 1%\\nFavorable impact from period cost absorbed as inventories are expected to increase to support higher production level\\nThese favorable items will be partially offset by higher short term incentive compensation expense of about $1 billion\\nMaterial costs are now expected to be about flat for the full year\\nWhile geopolitical uncertainty and commodity volatility continue to be risks to the outlook, our outlook assumes that oil prices remain bound within the recent range of volatility, markets stay resilient to geopolitical uncertainties, and China remains supportive of growth\\nHowever, changes to any of these variables as well as others could impact our sales and revenues outlook for the full year\\nWe'll turn to slide 15 and wrap up\\nOperational performance for the year has been strong with second quarter operating profit pull-through of nearly 50%\\nWhile a number of our end markets remain challenged, we see strong demand in deliveries for China construction and North America gas compression equipment\\nAnd demand for aftermarket parts has increased to support overhaul and maintenance activity for well servicing, gas compression, and mining equipment\\nOrders and end user demand for North American construction equipment also improved in the quarter\\nWe continue to be focused on lean, product quality, and investing in the business for future growth\\nThe balance sheet remains strong, and we delivered $2 billion in ME&T operating cash flow in the quarter\\nGiven year to date performance and our confidence in the second half of the year, we are raising the outlook for both sales and revenues and profit per share\\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Amy\\nAnn, this is Brad Halverson\\nMaybe just another comment about how we use that language\\nWe use that language because that's how we're operating internally\\nWe have now been through four years of a downturn\\nIt's been hard on us\\nWe've taken significant restructuring activities and we like where our cost structure is at and where our balance sheet is at\\nAnd so using our operating and execution model, Jim is really driving continued focus on cost reduction across the support areas, and as we increase period cost, you'll see that there'll be very targeted in areas that offer the most long term value for the company consistent with kind of the pools of OPACC we see out there in the future\\nAnd this is a little example in the second half of this year where we're going to take an opportunity to do a little bit of that where we think there's a lot of value and keep the lid on the other costs that we have in the company\\nYeah, I'd say, Ann, actually I think not because this time I've been in a career here at Cat a long time\\nTypically, we have reductions in areas that are easy to find\\nSo we reduce R&D or reduce other things\\nIn this downturn, if you look at our cost reduction, it's been highly targeted to areas that are not kind of future value\\nThey're areas of efficiency and consolidation and support cost\\nWe have really increased spending in many of the growth areas\\nWe've protected R&D by and large, and we've protected things like digital spending\\nSo we've taken an entirely different approach in this downturn in terms of where we took cost out and what cost we protected\\nSo I would say it's different than we would have historically done\",\n          \"Good morning, everyone\\nLet me start with the headlines for the quarter\\nSales and earnings were down slightly, reflecting a challenging environment, as Tom just described, and comparison to strong results last year\\nWe delivered significant cost savings in the quarter, and we've increased our full year cost savings outlook\\nAnd finally, we're on track with our overall capital plan\\nNow let's take a look at the details, starting with sales\\nOur second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, that's down 1% year-on-year due to lower organic sales\\nTom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes\\nOn profitability, second quarter gross margin was 36.1%, that's down 20 basis points year-on-year\\nOperating margin was 17.5%, down 50 basis points\\nWhile margins were down slightly overall, I'm encouraged with the improvements that we achieved in our Personal Care and K-C Professional business segments, and also in the developing and emerging markets overall\\nCommodities were a $75 million drag in the second quarter, and for the full year, we're now expecting inflation of $200 million to $300 million, that's $50 million higher than our previous estimate driven by higher pulp costs\\nOur teams continued to deliver significant FORCE cost savings\\nSecond quarter savings were $120 million and we've increased our full year savings target to $425 million to $450 million\\nOur original target was for savings of at least $400 million\\nGiven the current environment, we are also tightly managing our overhead spending\\nOn the bottom line, second quarter earnings per share were $1.49, down 3% year-on-year\\nLower equity income reduced earnings by $0.03 per share, offset by a lower share count and a slightly better effective tax rate\\nNow let's take a look at cash flow\\nCash provided by operations in the second quarter was $825 million, in line with our expectations\\nCash flow was down compared to $860 million in the year-ago quarter, including the impact of higher tax payments this year\\nSecond quarter working capital cash conversion cycle was down six days compared to full year 2016, bringing the year-to-date decline to five days\\nWe're making very good progress in this area, and we expect to nicely exceed our original one-day improvement target for the full year\\nWe also continue to manage capital spending in this environment, and we now expect that full year spending will be in the lower half of our $850 million to $950 million target range\\nOn capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $600 million\\nWe continue to expect that full year dividends and share repurchases will total between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion\\nLooking at our segments, in Personal Care, organic sales fell 1% due to lower net selling prices\\nOrganic sales were up 2% in developing and emerging markets but were down elsewhere\\nPersonal Care operating margins were 20.6%, up 60 basis points\\nThe improvement was driven by cost savings, partially offset by lower selling prices and higher input costs\\nIn Consumer Tissue, organic sales were down 2%, driven by North America\\nOverall, Consumer Tissue operating margins were 16.5%, down 190 basis points\\nThe results were impacted by lower sales and higher pulp costs\\nIn K-C Professional, organic sales in the quarter were up 1%, with gains in all major geographies\\nK-C Professional operating margins were 20.1%, up 150 basis points\\nThe comparison included benefits from cost savings\\nSo in summary, our second quarter results were impacted by difficult environment with weaker economies, category softness and increased competitive activity\\nNonetheless, we are achieving strong cost savings, we're generating healthy cash flow, and we're allocating capital in shareholder-friendly ways\\nI'll now turn the call back over to Tom\\nYeah, we do continue to deliver significant cost savings through the FORCE program, and we were able to take up the full year target\\nAnd what I'd say is that as the program name implies, our teams really are Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere\\nWhen you look at our supply chain savings that includes improving productivity and waste across our manufacturing operations, driving down the cost of our facilities, optimizing the cost of our product specifications and continually negotiating lower input costs or material costs of our products\\nAnd year-to-date, we are at 4% of cost of goods, which is really a strong performance, not only internally but benchmarks very well\\nI continue to see opportunities for us to continue to deliver the FORCE cost savings as we move forward\\nSo good performance there, and I think more opportunity there\\nSure\\nOn the buyback, the $800 million to $1 billion is still the right number for the year\\nWe're on track with that\\nAnd in terms of the interest expense, we did some pre-funding on the $950 million that comes due in August, which is why you see a higher debt number at the end of the quarter, but that should normalize\\nAnd the debt that we'll take out in August is a pretty high coupon, it's 6.125%, and so that will be replaced with lower interest rate debt and that should bring the interest expense down for the year\",\n          \"Thanks, Rob\\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Walmart's investor relations call to discuss third quarter earnings\\nThis is Steve Schmitt, and I'm joined today by, Kary Brunner, Michael Brigance, Joey Smith, and Miguel Garcia from the IR team\\nHopefully, you've seen our materials we issued this morning\\nI'm going to hit on a couple of key points in a minute, and then we'll open the call for Q&A\\nThere will be forward-looking statements on today's call, which are subject to future events and uncertainties\\nActual results could differ materially from these statements\\nPlease review the full Safe Harbor statement accompanying our earnings materials\\nSo let me talk about a few highlights in the quarter\\nWe had a really strong quarter\\nWe have broad-based growth\\nOn a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales were up 3.8%, an increase of $4.5 billion\\nWe delivered adjusted EPS of $1. You notice our GAAP EPS was $0.58 a share\\nSo we adjusted GAAP EPS for three items that are detailed in the release, I'll hit on the three of them\\nWe recently completed a debt tender offer\\nWe made an FCPA accrual regarding possible resolution of the FCPA matter\\nWe made the exit of certain properties in one of our international markets\\nSo excluding these items, our adjusted EPS was $1. We have good momentum in sales growth across the business\\ncomp sales growth was 2.7%, with comp traffic up 1.5%\\nWe saw about a 30 to 50 point positive impact to the comp from recent hurricanes\\nOur Walmart U.S\\neCommerce sales grew 50%\\nSam's comp sales grew 2.8% led by traffic and also had a benefit from the hurricanes\\nInternational delivered another solid quarter with 10 of 11 markets reporting positive comp sales\\nExcluding the charge for the FCPA accrual we disclosed today, we would have leveraged expenses as a company in the quarter, which has been a point of emphasis for us\\nWe're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.38 to $4.46, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $4.30 to $4.40. Fourth quarter Walmart U.S\\ncomp sales are expected to increase between 1.5% and 2% on more difficult compares\\nJust a couple of reminders\\nWe'll release our fourth quarter earnings on February 20, 2018. And like to let everyone know that next year's earnings release dates will be posted to our website\\nSo please mark your calendars for that\\nAnd at this point, we'd be happy to take your questions\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nThanks, Michael\\nLet me talk about maybe two things; gross margin on a consolidated basis, and then on a U.S\\nbasis\\nSo on a consolidated basis, gross profit rate declined 29 basis points\\nAnd you hit on several of the items, so on a consolidated basis, we have price investments in certain markets, mix effects of eCommerce, which you mentioned, and keep in mind the U.S\\nhurricane-related expenses that we had\\nI'd also like to point your attention to operating margin and some of the things that just we'd like you to pay attention to, as we called out some items such as the FCPA accrual, international impairments, and hurricane impacts\\nSo just keep these in mind when you're looking at overall operating profit performance in the quarter\\nFor Walmart U.S\\nspecifically, gross profit margin declined 36 basis points in the quarter\\nPrice investments, as you mentioned, mix effects of eCommerce impacted as well\\nAnd the hurricane specifically, we estimate impacted the gross profit decline of about a third of that\\nSo I'm not getting into all the details specifically, we continue to invest in price\\nWe're operating with more discipline, and we'll continue to look ways to manage our margin, and ways that work for our customers and work for our shareholders\\nIt's really the productivity beginning to turn for us\\nSo you could see gross profit margin pressure from time-to-time, and we need to get more disciplined with expenses\\nSo if you think about our business, and certainly our DNA, we're about offering everyday low prices, both in-store and online\\nThe fact is, some products are just cheaper to sell in stores, think about items like bottled water, so you'll see some price differences from time-to-time\\nThanks, Oliver\\nSo the first question around smart cart technology\\nIt's something that we continue to look at\\nWe need to be thoughtful about it as we think about putting that potentially on Walmart\\ncom, but nothing really more to add at this time\\nIn terms of the Lord & Taylor relationship, it's going to be a unique experience\\nThink about it as a flagship store\\nThis is expected to launch in the spring\\nIt will be dedicated store on Walmart\\nWe're excited about the relationship, the deep relationships Lord & Taylor has with great brands, and we know our customers look for premium brands on our site\\nSo we think it's a good agreement, and we look forward to the spring\\nWell, I think there's a lot of things\\nIf you talk to Greg Foran, the CEO of our U.S\\nbusiness, he could probably list a list of 20 to 30, maybe even more than that, from the time the customer walks in the door to the time they check out, from a booking standpoint\\nSo, we continue to look at it\\nI think you can tell in our results, the customers like the changes that we're making in our stores, and we'll continue to look to make a better experience so they continue shopping with us\\nWe continue to make progress on inventory\\nYou've seen more incremental improvements versus, I'd say, the step change improvements we saw last year, and we'll continue to look for improvements we can make in the business\\nI think it's a fair way to look at it, Simeon\\nWell, if you think about Jet, and thanks for bringing that up\\nJet was in the comp for a month, the way our comp calculations work\\nSo there really wasn't much of an impact in the third quarter results\\nReally the way we think about eCommerce is really in total\\nJet is a piece of our eCommerce business overall\\nWe made the decision earlier this year to give more transparency on our U.S\\neCommerce business, and we furthered that in our October meeting, so we'll continue to report on the eCommerce business as a whole\\nIn terms of a glide path, we feel good about the direction of our eCommerce business\\nI think this quarter is another good example of that and we will report that as we go\\nBut in terms of any glide path or volatility, we'll wait and see\\nThank you\\nMaybe I'll give a few comments and turn it over to Kary to give a little more detail\\nSo we'll take the inflation piece first\\nSo the way we've reported inflation on food is really excluding the price investment that we've made and as we got into this quarter we think it's a very \\u2013 it's \\u2013 you talked about what Brett said in his remarks, which is in a similar range or below what we reported which was 30 basis points of inflation in the past quarter\\nThe fact is it's getting a little bit more difficult for us to really be precise with that number as we look at our price investment markets\\nAs we anniversary some of those price investments, it's just becoming a little bit more difficult, so we'll give you as directional as a number as we can to help you analyze that business going forward\\nIn terms of the grocery business or the food business overall specifically, you mentioned online grocery pick up\\nWe know that that's working for our customers\\nWe continue to expand it\\nWe're in 1,100 locations now and expect to add another 1,000 next year\\nSo that's a big initiative for us\\nIt's working and our customers love it\\nIn terms of other things that are working, it's, again, it's a lot of different things\\nIt's expanding assortment, it's quality of product, having in-stocks and price is a component of it as well\\nKary, anything else you want to add?\\nWe won't give the specifics of that\\nIt's working for us based on our rollout plans\\nThanks, Robby\\nAnd I appreciate it\\nSo I think we have to manage labor costs like we manage other expenses in our business\\nOne of the big initiatives that we have is, as we grow the business we want to be more disciplined with our costs\\nWe need to be more efficient\\nWe talked about some of the technology enablers that are helping with that\\nWe have to manage labor costs and we have to look to do that in the most efficient way we can to reach the margin objectives that we have\\nSo that's what we continue to do\\nI think you think about freight just like the other variables that we manage in the business\\nWe have a lot of experience managing the P&L and whether it's labor or freight, we have to pull different levers to deliver on the objective that we have in the freight would be no exception\\nBut I don't have any specifics for you in terms of freight cost increasing\\nRob, next question please?\\nWell, you mentioned the sales piece of it which certainly helped\\nBut it's really about becoming more disciplined with our expenses overall\\nI know we had been talking about that for a while now and it's a big objective of ours going forward\\nThere's not one thing, it's just about being more efficient with the business overall\\nIt's great that we started to see that in the third quarter\\nWe've talked about our goals next year to leverage expenses and we'll continue to push towards that\\nBut it's not one thing, it's a lot\\nThanks, Karen\\nRob, next question please?\\nThanks for your question\\nSo, we continue to execute our pricing strategy that we laid out, I guess, two years ago now\\nThe details of that, and you're not going to be surprised to hear me say that, that we keep pretty close to the vest\\nSo pricing is a piece of what we're doing, along with customer experience and all the other initiatives that we have to grow the top line\\nSo we're not going to give specific details of pricing, but we continue to execute the strategy, and our customers are responding\\nWell, if you think about the Walmart customer base overall, it's actually a pretty good mirror image of the U.S\\npopulation in general\\nWe're pleased with how new customers are using us in multiple ways, and really an omni experience we laid out in our October meeting, that the omni customer certainly spends more with us than single channel customers\\nSo we continue to push that forward\\nIn terms of different age groups or whatnot that are adopting at a faster order, we don't have that particular information\\nBut we continue to move customers into the omni experience at Walmart, to use our brands in different ways\\nWe're expanding our online grocery pick up, almost doubling it next year\\nWe'll continue to do that, because we know that that's where the customer wants to use us in multiple channels, and we'll continue to forge ahead with that\\nWe do quite a bit of research as you would expect, Chuck\\nSo there's a lot of scientific data that we get, now I won't give you a scientific answer\\nThe real \\u2013 I think the nuts and bolts of it is that we think the customers reasonably, I mean, is doing reasonably well\\nWe haven't seen a marked change over the last several quarters, certainly in our results we continue to, I mean, this quarter is a good indication that our initiatives are appealing to the customer, but we don't see a marked change in customers right now\\nThat's really a different product mix and more than anything\\nIn terms of the associate delivery test, we continue to learn from what we're doing\\nIt's certainly an initiative that leverages the unique assets that we have\\nBut not only associate delivery, but ground-based platforms to solve for last mile for really quick delivery for our customers\\nSo we continue to watch that and learn from it\\nAnd nothing you can tell from our fourth quarter guidance of 1.5% to 2% that we feel pretty good about the momentum we have\\nMaybe I'll take the second part of your question first Paul\\nIn terms of the hurricane piece, I think we're as specific as we can be with what we laid out in the quarter with the Walmart U.S\\nbusiness, the 30 to 50 point comp benefit\\nSam's I think was 70 to 90 basis points\\nWe talked about the net of sales and increased cost, gross margin and SG&A to be about $150 million headwind for the U.S\\nbusiness and about $20 million for Sam's\\nSo I think we probably gave as much information as we could from that standpoint\\nIn terms of Sam's overall, I think in the comp piece of it, what I'd point you to more than anything is strong traffic\\nSo a 3.6% member traffic growth\\nWe have members coming in more frequently\\nWe have initiatives like Scan and Go that make it easier for members to come in and shop at clubs\\nAnd that's what I would point you to is traffic up 3.6% in the quarter\\nMatt, it's really the same factors that have driven health and wellness and relatively consistent performance\\nThere was a pick up this quarter as we continue to see script growth in our pharmacy, traffic is very healthy and we also have some new items in over-the-counter that are doing well and some of that obviously is driven by sickness so Cold, Cough & Flu (26:44) was strong this quarter, but branded drug inflation as well is a fact there, but really kind of the same factors that you've heard us talk about over the last couple of quarters, just a bit of a pickup in traffic this quarter\\nI mean, we did see some higher dollar purchases from the GM side\\nSee from a geography standpoint it's SG&A, SG&A overall\\nAnd one thing to point out on the FCPA is, it did drive the quarterly tax rate up\\nSo if you're looking at the year-over-year tax rate, the majority of it was driven by that particular accrual\\nI think the key is to be flexible\\nIf you look at some of the partnerships we've had around the business, I'd point you to JD initially in China, to partner with really one of the largest eCommerce platforms in China, that's where a partnership makes sense\\nYou have brands that we acquired, like Bonobos specifically, that give us really the unique access to great brands like Bonobos that we can leverage to be (29:14) proprietary to our platforms\\nAnd then you have things like Lord & Taylor that you can partner, a capital-light way to bring great brands to your site that we think would work for both parties\\nSo I think the key is to be flexible, and we'll continue to be flexible as we look to build our assortment and give customers more options\\nI think it's tough to dissect and I don't have any, I don't think, useful information, particularly on ladies apparel\\nBut, look, when you have a business of our scale that's growing like we did in the third quarter, I think you're taking share\\nIt's hard to dissect on who from\\nSo I don't really have any color on any specifics on that for you\\nBut thanks for your question, Kate\\nThanks for the question\\nI think it's TBD\\nI think we'll continue to test, learn, and move forward\\nWe have a lot of initiatives underway\\nA lot of you that came to Bentonville last month saw a lot of them, there were things that we're doing in-store that we're excited about\\nSo I think you'll see us test, take some swings, see what works, and expand and fail fast on some initiatives too\\nWe certainly take a look at the competitive environment, that's something we've done at Walmart for a long time\\nSo we continue to do that\\nOur brand is about everyday low prices on baskets of goods, that's where the customers trust our brands for and (32:12) we'll continue to make sure we do that\\nBigger baskets was a piece of it, Scot\\nIt's over 70 million\\nIn the last summer, we gave, I think it was 67 million\\nSo we continue to make progress\\nThank you\\nThanks for your question, Joe\\nAnd we appreciate you notice in the KitchenAid's part of our assortment now and you may have seen that we also have Bose, which is \\u2013 it's a great brand that now is associated with us\\nSo, you worry about that, I think you always watch and learn and we look at the data\\nWe analyze the data really well\\nWe know that customers are looking for premium brands on our website\\nWe think it helps the brand overall\\nSo we'll watch brands like that\\nWe're happy to have them as part of our assortment and we'll continue to learn\\nI think pricing is a piece of it\\nBut I think over the last, call it, at least 12 months maybe closer to 18 months now, there's been an increased focus on getting back to the basics, giving the customer a better experience and we're starting to see some green shoots there\\nThanks, guys\\nWe don't have any more questions in the queue\\nSo I just wanted to thank everyone for their time, for your interest in Walmart and happy holidays\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Stock_Ticker\",\n

We continued to execute on our restructuring plan which includes the closure and consolidation of more than 30 facilities\\nThese actions are important to achieving the flexible cost structure required to remain profitable through the cycles\\nAt the same time, we are thoughtfully preserving the capacity needed to meet future growth needs\\nAs a result of restructuring actions, we incurred $169 million in restructuring costs in the quarter, $30 million more than in the second quarter of 2016. In the quarter, we also recognized a pre-tax gain of $85 million on the sale of our investment in IronPlanet\\nAdjusted profit per share was up $0.40 from $1.09 in the second quarter of 2016 to $1.49. Higher sales, including a favorable mix, were the primary drivers of the profit improvement\\nImproved price on lower variable manufacturing costs were about offset by higher period cost due to an increase to the short-term incentive compensation accrual that resulted from the upward revision to the outlook\\nNow let's turn to slide five\\nSecond quarter operating profit was $1.251 billion as compared with $785 million in 2016, up $466 million\\nOperating profit pull-through in the quarter was nearly 50%\\nPositive changes to operating profit came from several areas\\nThe largest increase to profit was a result of higher sales volume and favorable mix\\nAll four geographic regions and all three primary product segments saw higher sales and revenues\\nHowever, increases to sales and revenues were largely concentrated in four end markets\\nChina construction and North America gas compression continued to experience strength, and robust overhaul and maintenance activity drove higher aftermarket parts sales for both mining and well servicing equipment\\nPrice improved $183 million in the quarter\\nThe favorable change was largely due to Construction Industries as Resource Industries and Energy and Transportation price realization were about flat\\nVariable manufacturing costs were favorable $44 million, largely due to the favorable impact of period cost absorbed as inventories increased in the quarter in many of our factories to support higher production\\nAs we ramp up production, we remain focused on lean principles, and we are working diligently to bring production up quickly but also efficiently\\nMaterial costs were about flat in the quarter\\nWhile our design and procurement teams continue to work on projects to lower material costs through redesign and resourcing, we expect higher steel cost to put pressure on material cost in the second half\\nSo while period costs were higher by $237 million, in the quarter we accrued about $330 million more short-term incentive compensation for ME&T than the second quarter of last year\\nWhen exclude the higher STIP accrual, period costs were lower by about $80 million driven by restructuring and cost reduction actions over the past year that are focused on lowering the company's embedded cost structure\\nAs we have weathered through the challenges of the last few years, maintaining a strong balance sheet has been a priority and we are continuing that focus\\nME&T operating cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and is $3.6 billion year-to-date, both well above prior year comparables\\nME&T debt-to-cap at the end of the quarter was 38.6%, well within our targeted range\\nWe ended the quarter with $10.2 billion in enterprise cash, and in June the board approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend which we expect will make 2017 the 24th year in a row of paying higher dividends to our shareholders\\nNow let's move on to discuss each of the segments, and we'll start with slide six\\nConstruction Industry sales were up 11% to $4.9 billion\\nHigher sales volume to Asia Pacific and Latin America and favorable price realization contributed to the increase\\nMost of the sales increase in the quarter for Construction Industries was driven by what has continued to be strong end user demand in China for construction equipment, most notably excavators\\nThrough the first half of the year, the 10 ton and above excavator industry in China was up about 130% from last year\\nStrength in China continues to be driven by government support for infrastructure and strong residential investment\\nSales in China in the second quarter were better than we had expected, and we now expect demand in China to remain strong through the rest of the year\\nIf you look at the chart at the top of the right-hand side of slide six, it shows China industry sales for 10 ton and above sized excavators from 2006 through 2017 forecast\\nYou can see from the chart that while demand for 10 ton and above excavators is up significantly versus the last two years, it is still far below highs achieved earlier this decade\\nContinued strength in China is dependent on underlying demand, government support and accommodating credit conditions For Latin America, sales were higher due to an increase in end user demand across several South American countries as well as favorable dealer inventory changes\\nWhile we saw some regions improve in the quarter, Latin America, especially Brazil, remained challenged, and sales are still at very low levels\\nNorth America sales to end users were up and price realization improved\\nHowever, these were mostly offset by a drop in dealer inventory\\nNorth America dealers typically pull from inventory in the second quarter to support the strong selling season\\nHowever, this year the reduction in dealer inventory drawdown was greater than last year, resulting in an unfavorable impact to sale\\nAs you can see in the chart on the bottom right-hand side of the slide, higher end user demand in North America was primarily driven by improved residential and non-residential construction\\nAs the chart also shows, infrastructure spend in the U.S\\nhas been stagnant for some time, and sales of construction equipment for infrastructure projects was down in the quarter as we have yet to see federal, state and local funding for road projects translate into higher sales\\nThe United States is in need of infrastructure investment\\nPassage of a federal infrastructure bill would be positive for our country and our business\\nAs expected, in the middle of the spring and summer selling season, the backlog for construction industries was down from the first quarter of 2017. However, the decrease this quarter of about $300 million was less than the first quarter to second quarter reductions in both 2015 and 2016 when the backlog went down by $1 billion and $900 million respectively\\nOrder rates were strong in the quarter with all regions seeing an improvement from year ago\\nLet's move to slide seven\\nConstruction Industries segment profit was favorable by about $350 million driven by favorable price realization and higher sales volume, including a favorable mix of products\\nPeriod costs were about flat as higher short-term incentive compensation expense was largely offset by restructuring and cost reduction actions\\nConstruction Industries was an early adopter of our operating and execution model, and this focus has helped to improve their segment profitability\\nSegment profit margin in the quarter was 18.2%, an increase of almost 600 basis points from the second quarter of last year\\nLet's move to slide eight and Resource Industries\\nContinued strong demand for after-market parts to support overhauls and maintenance work combined with favorable changes to dealer inventories were the primary drivers of the $300 million increase in sales and revenues for Resource Industries; an increase of 21%\\nIn order to call a recovery in mining, we have said that first the excess machine inventory in the mines would need to be worked off\\nThen demand for overhauls and maintenance would drive higher aftermarket part sales\\nAnd last, orders for new equipment would start to increase\\nThe cycle is starting to play out\\nUtilization on trucks is up 4% from last year\\nThe part fleet continues to come down, and for the fifth quarter in a row, part sales have increased to support rebuild and maintenance needs as well as higher utilization of fleets in the mines\\nAnd our order rates are improving\\nAfter four years of dealers reducing their inventories, for the second sequential quarter, dealer inventory held about flat\\nSales increases and favorable dealer inventory changes were broad based across all regions\\nAs you saw in the sales to user numbers that were released yesterday, RI sales to users were about flat in the quarter\\nHowever, we believe sales to users are a lagging indicator of industry trend\\nOrder rates in the quarter were up more than double the second quarter of last year\\nThe backlog for Resource Industries was up about $300 million from the end of the first quarter 2017, and Resource Industries was a significant part of the $3 billion increase in the backlog since the second quarter of last year\\nHowever, while Resource Industries has started to recover, sales volumes remain at historically low level\\nWe'll move to slide nine and look at their operating performance\\nOn improving sales with a focus on operational performance, Resource Industries delivered a solid quarter\\nSegment profit was $97 million, up $260 million from a loss of $163 million in 2016. The improvement in profit resulted from higher sales volume, including a favorable mix of products and lower period cost\\nResource Industries continues to implement a number of restructuring actions to lower their breakeven point\\nThese initiatives enabled them to deliver lower period cost in the quarter even after recognizing a large increase in short-term incentive compensation expense\\nResource Industries incurred additional warranty expense of a little over $50 million in the quarter for a customer program we do not expect to repeat\\nNext we'll go through Energy and Transportation on slide ten\\nSales were up $200 million or 5% in the quarter to $3.9 billion\\nHigher sales into oil and gas combined with higher industrial aftermarket sales were the primary drivers of the sales increase\\nSales into power generation were about flat as a slight improvement in North America was mostly offset by weaknesses in other regions\\nTransportation sales decreased, largely due to lower demand for marine application\\nSales into the rail industry were about flat\\nWhile the rail industry remains weak and the number of stored locomotives remains elevated, this was mostly offset in the quarter by an increase in rail services to support higher rail traffic\\nThe chart on the right side of slide 10 shows the four-year history of U.S\\nrig counts and west Texas intermediate oil prices\\nThe number of rigs in production has doubled from recent lows reached in May of 2016. U.S\\noil production has increased accordingly\\nIn the areas where we participate in the oil and gas market, the recent strength has largely been concentrated to well servicing and midstream gas compression applications\\nDemand for aftermarket parts to support overhaul and maintenance of well servicing fleets increased in the quarter, primarily to support rigs that are going back to work in the Permian Basin and other shale formations in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico where the cost of production and transportation is low enough to encourage investment despite recent oil price volatility\\nMidstream gas compression is having another good year as we support the continued buildout of North America's natural gas infrastructure\\nIn addition, recent developments in the Permian in the last 12 months have had a higher concentration of natural gas than previous wells\\nThis discovery has contributed to a higher demand for 3500 and 3600 reciprocating engines to support the midstream gas compression growth in that region\\nWe move to slide 11; we'll look at the segment for Energy and Transportation\\nEnergy and Transportation profit was up $98 million from $602 million to $700 million\\nThis was largely attributable to higher sales volume, a favorable impact from cost absorption and improved material cost\\nPeriod cost increased in the quarter but were about flat after excluding higher short term incentive compensation expense\\nBefore I move on to the outlook, a quick comment on financial products\\nOperating profit was down slightly due to the absence of the sale of securities at Cat Insurance Services\\nThe portfolio remains healthy with past dues down 22 basis points in the second quarter of 2016 and write-offs were down $7 million\\nUsed equipment prices continued to improve which helped, and the team delivered a solid quarter\\nWe'll move to slide 12, and we'll cover the outlook\\nWe announced this morning that we are raising the outlook for full year sales and revenues and profit per share\\nIn April we provided an outlook for sales and revenues of $38 billion to $41 billion\\nAs a result of strong operational performance in the first half, encouraging order rate, good economic indicators and a solid backlog, we are providing new guidance for sales and revenues in the range of $42 billion to $44 billion with a midpoint of $43 billion, up $3.5 billion from the prior outlook\\nAt the midpoint of the sales and revenues range, we have raised the profit per share outlook to $3.50 per share and raised the adjusted profit per share outlook from $3.75 to $5. We'll move on to slide 13 and cover the sales outlook by segment\\nWe now expect Construction Industries sales for the year to be up 10% to 15% versus the previous outlook of flat to up 5%\\nThis is driven largely by higher end user demand in both China and North America\\nOrder rates for Construction Industries have been strong through the first half of the year across most regions with an exception of the Middle East and Brazil which remain challenged\\nThe backlog is also up significantly from the second quarter of 2016. We do expect sales in the second half of the year to be slightly lower than the first half\\nFor Construction Industries, the second quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year as construction activity and deliveries pick up to support the spring and summer construction season in the Northern Hemisphere\\nFewer workdays due to holidays and vacations combined with the anticipation of colder weather typically drives sales lower in the second half\\nIn China, on average for the last five years, over 55% of sales were realized in the first half of the year\\nFor Resource Industries, we now expect sales to be up 20% to 25% for the full year versus the previous outlook of up 10% to 15%\\nWhile we expect aftermarket part sales to remain strong through the rest of the year as the number of parked trucks is reduced and the demand for overhauls declines, we expect the rate of growth to slow, and for part sales to be lower in the second half than the first\\nHowever, we expect this will be more than offset by an increase in new equipment sales\\nEnergy and Transportation sales are forecasted to be up 5% to 10% for the year versus the previous outlook of about flat\\nWe continue to see strong rebuild activity in well servicing for engines, transmission, pumps, and flow iron, and new equipment deliveries are expected to increase in the second half of the year\\nWe also expect shipments to North America gas compression customers to be higher in the second half\\nIndustrial, power generation and transportation are all expected to be about flat to slightly up\\nWe move to slide 14. At the midpoint of the sales and revenue range, the new outlook for profit per share is $3.50 and the revised outlook for adjusted profit per share is $5. The increase in the profit outlook since April is largely the result of the improved forecast for sales and revenues and disciplined cost control partially offset by an increase in short term incentive compensation expense\\nAs compared to 2016 at the midpoint of the range, the revised outlook reflects higher sales and revenues of about $4.5 billion or 12%, and an increase in adjusted profit per share of $1.58. The increase in adjusted profit per share versus 2016 is largely driven by higher sales volume of $4.5 billion and the associated margin on those sales\\nFavorable price, while we do not expect the same level of price favorability in the second half of the year, we still expect favorable price realization for the full year in a range of 0.5% to 1%\\nFavorable impact from period cost absorbed as inventories are expected to increase to support higher production level\\nThese favorable items will be partially offset by higher short term incentive compensation expense of about $1 billion\\nMaterial costs are now expected to be about flat for the full year\\nWhile geopolitical uncertainty and commodity volatility continue to be risks to the outlook, our outlook assumes that oil prices remain bound within the recent range of volatility, markets stay resilient to geopolitical uncertainties, and China remains supportive of growth\\nHowever, changes to any of these variables as well as others could impact our sales and revenues outlook for the full year\\nWe'll turn to slide 15 and wrap up\\nOperational performance for the year has been strong with second quarter operating profit pull-through of nearly 50%\\nWhile a number of our end markets remain challenged, we see strong demand in deliveries for China construction and North America gas compression equipment\\nAnd demand for aftermarket parts has increased to support overhaul and maintenance activity for well servicing, gas compression, and mining equipment\\nOrders and end user demand for North American construction equipment also improved in the quarter\\nWe continue to be focused on lean, product quality, and investing in the business for future growth\\nThe balance sheet remains strong, and we delivered $2 billion in ME&T operating cash flow in the quarter\\nGiven year to date performance and our confidence in the second half of the year, we are raising the outlook for both sales and revenues and profit per share\\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Amy\\nAnn, this is Brad Halverson\\nMaybe just another comment about how we use that language\\nWe use that language because that's how we're operating internally\\nWe have now been through four years of a downturn\\nIt's been hard on us\\nWe've taken significant restructuring activities and we like where our cost structure is at and where our balance sheet is at\\nAnd so using our operating and execution model, Jim is really driving continued focus on cost reduction across the support areas, and as we increase period cost, you'll see that there'll be very targeted in areas that offer the most long term value for the company consistent with kind of the pools of OPACC we see out there in the future\\nAnd this is a little example in the second half of this year where we're going to take an opportunity to do a little bit of that where we think there's a lot of value and keep the lid on the other costs that we have in the company\\nYeah, I'd say, Ann, actually I think not because this time I've been in a career here at Cat a long time\\nTypically, we have reductions in areas that are easy to find\\nSo we reduce R&D or reduce other things\\nIn this downturn, if you look at our cost reduction, it's been highly targeted to areas that are not kind of future value\\nThey're areas of efficiency and consolidation and support cost\\nWe have really increased spending in many of the growth areas\\nWe've protected R&D by and large, and we've protected things like digital spending\\nSo we've taken an entirely different approach in this downturn in terms of where we took cost out and what cost we protected\\nSo I would say it's different than we would have historically done\",\n          \"Good morning, everyone\\nLet me start with the headlines for the quarter\\nSales and earnings were down slightly, reflecting a challenging environment, as Tom just described, and comparison to strong results last year\\nWe delivered significant cost savings in the quarter, and we've increased our full year cost savings outlook\\nAnd finally, we're on track with our overall capital plan\\nNow let's take a look at the details, starting with sales\\nOur second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, that's down 1% year-on-year due to lower organic sales\\nTom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes\\nOn profitability, second quarter gross margin was 36.1%, that's down 20 basis points year-on-year\\nOperating margin was 17.5%, down 50 basis points\\nWhile margins were down slightly overall, I'm encouraged with the improvements that we achieved in our Personal Care and K-C Professional business segments, and also in the developing and emerging markets overall\\nCommodities were a $75 million drag in the second quarter, and for the full year, we're now expecting inflation of $200 million to $300 million, that's $50 million higher than our previous estimate driven by higher pulp costs\\nOur teams continued to deliver significant FORCE cost savings\\nSecond quarter savings were $120 million and we've increased our full year savings target to $425 million to $450 million\\nOur original target was for savings of at least $400 million\\nGiven the current environment, we are also tightly managing our overhead spending\\nOn the bottom line, second quarter earnings per share were $1.49, down 3% year-on-year\\nLower equity income reduced earnings by $0.03 per share, offset by a lower share count and a slightly better effective tax rate\\nNow let's take a look at cash flow\\nCash provided by operations in the second quarter was $825 million, in line with our expectations\\nCash flow was down compared to $860 million in the year-ago quarter, including the impact of higher tax payments this year\\nSecond quarter working capital cash conversion cycle was down six days compared to full year 2016, bringing the year-to-date decline to five days\\nWe're making very good progress in this area, and we expect to nicely exceed our original one-day improvement target for the full year\\nWe also continue to manage capital spending in this environment, and we now expect that full year spending will be in the lower half of our $850 million to $950 million target range\\nOn capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $600 million\\nWe continue to expect that full year dividends and share repurchases will total between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion\\nLooking at our segments, in Personal Care, organic sales fell 1% due to lower net selling prices\\nOrganic sales were up 2% in developing and emerging markets but were down elsewhere\\nPersonal Care operating margins were 20.6%, up 60 basis points\\nThe improvement was driven by cost savings, partially offset by lower selling prices and higher input costs\\nIn Consumer Tissue, organic sales were down 2%, driven by North America\\nOverall, Consumer Tissue operating margins were 16.5%, down 190 basis points\\nThe results were impacted by lower sales and higher pulp costs\\nIn K-C Professional, organic sales in the quarter were up 1%, with gains in all major geographies\\nK-C Professional operating margins were 20.1%, up 150 basis points\\nThe comparison included benefits from cost savings\\nSo in summary, our second quarter results were impacted by difficult environment with weaker economies, category softness and increased competitive activity\\nNonetheless, we are achieving strong cost savings, we're generating healthy cash flow, and we're allocating capital in shareholder-friendly ways\\nI'll now turn the call back over to Tom\\nYeah, we do continue to deliver significant cost savings through the FORCE program, and we were able to take up the full year target\\nAnd what I'd say is that as the program name implies, our teams really are Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere\\nWhen you look at our supply chain savings that includes improving productivity and waste across our manufacturing operations, driving down the cost of our facilities, optimizing the cost of our product specifications and continually negotiating lower input costs or material costs of our products\\nAnd year-to-date, we are at 4% of cost of goods, which is really a strong performance, not only internally but benchmarks very well\\nI continue to see opportunities for us to continue to deliver the FORCE cost savings as we move forward\\nSo good performance there, and I think more opportunity there\\nSure\\nOn the buyback, the $800 million to $1 billion is still the right number for the year\\nWe're on track with that\\nAnd in terms of the interest expense, we did some pre-funding on the $950 million that comes due in August, which is why you see a higher debt number at the end of the quarter, but that should normalize\\nAnd the debt that we'll take out in August is a pretty high coupon, it's 6.125%, and so that will be replaced with lower interest rate debt and that should bring the interest expense down for the year\",\n          \"Thanks, Rob\\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Walmart's investor relations call to discuss third quarter earnings\\nThis is Steve Schmitt, and I'm joined today by, Kary Brunner, Michael Brigance, Joey Smith, and Miguel Garcia from the IR team\\nHopefully, you've seen our materials we issued this morning\\nI'm going to hit on a couple of key points in a minute, and then we'll open the call for Q&A\\nThere will be forward-looking statements on today's call, which are subject to future events and uncertainties\\nActual results could differ materially from these statements\\nPlease review the full Safe Harbor statement accompanying our earnings materials\\nSo let me talk about a few highlights in the quarter\\nWe had a really strong quarter\\nWe have broad-based growth\\nOn a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales were up 3.8%, an increase of $4.5 billion\\nWe delivered adjusted EPS of $1. You notice our GAAP EPS was $0.58 a share\\nSo we adjusted GAAP EPS for three items that are detailed in the release, I'll hit on the three of them\\nWe recently completed a debt tender offer\\nWe made an FCPA accrual regarding possible resolution of the FCPA matter\\nWe made the exit of certain properties in one of our international markets\\nSo excluding these items, our adjusted EPS was $1. We have good momentum in sales growth across the business\\ncomp sales growth was 2.7%, with comp traffic up 1.5%\\nWe saw about a 30 to 50 point positive impact to the comp from recent hurricanes\\nOur Walmart U.S\\neCommerce sales grew 50%\\nSam's comp sales grew 2.8% led by traffic and also had a benefit from the hurricanes\\nInternational delivered another solid quarter with 10 of 11 markets reporting positive comp sales\\nExcluding the charge for the FCPA accrual we disclosed today, we would have leveraged expenses as a company in the quarter, which has been a point of emphasis for us\\nWe're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.38 to $4.46, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $4.30 to $4.40. Fourth quarter Walmart U.S\\ncomp sales are expected to increase between 1.5% and 2% on more difficult compares\\nJust a couple of reminders\\nWe'll release our fourth quarter earnings on February 20, 2018. And like to let everyone know that next year's earnings release dates will be posted to our website\\nSo please mark your calendars for that\\nAnd at this point, we'd be happy to take your questions\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nThanks, Michael\\nLet me talk about maybe two things; gross margin on a consolidated basis, and then on a U.S\\nbasis\\nSo on a consolidated basis, gross profit rate declined 29 basis points\\nAnd you hit on several of the items, so on a consolidated basis, we have price investments in certain markets, mix effects of eCommerce, which you mentioned, and keep in mind the U.S\\nhurricane-related expenses that we had\\nI'd also like to point your attention to operating margin and some of the things that just we'd like you to pay attention to, as we called out some items such as the FCPA accrual, international impairments, and hurricane impacts\\nSo just keep these in mind when you're looking at overall operating profit performance in the quarter\\nFor Walmart U.S\\nspecifically, gross profit margin declined 36 basis points in the quarter\\nPrice investments, as you mentioned, mix effects of eCommerce impacted as well\\nAnd the hurricane specifically, we estimate impacted the gross profit decline of about a third of that\\nSo I'm not getting into all the details specifically, we continue to invest in price\\nWe're operating with more discipline, and we'll continue to look ways to manage our margin, and ways that work for our customers and work for our shareholders\\nIt's really the productivity beginning to turn for us\\nSo you could see gross profit margin pressure from time-to-time, and we need to get more disciplined with expenses\\nSo if you think about our business, and certainly our DNA, we're about offering everyday low prices, both in-store and online\\nThe fact is, some products are just cheaper to sell in stores, think about items like bottled water, so you'll see some price differences from time-to-time\\nThanks, Oliver\\nSo the first question around smart cart technology\\nIt's something that we continue to look at\\nWe need to be thoughtful about it as we think about putting that potentially on Walmart\\ncom, but nothing really more to add at this time\\nIn terms of the Lord & Taylor relationship, it's going to be a unique experience\\nThink about it as a flagship store\\nThis is expected to launch in the spring\\nIt will be dedicated store on Walmart\\nWe're excited about the relationship, the deep relationships Lord & Taylor has with great brands, and we know our customers look for premium brands on our site\\nSo we think it's a good agreement, and we look forward to the spring\\nWell, I think there's a lot of things\\nIf you talk to Greg Foran, the CEO of our U.S\\nbusiness, he could probably list a list of 20 to 30, maybe even more than that, from the time the customer walks in the door to the time they check out, from a booking standpoint\\nSo, we continue to look at it\\nI think you can tell in our results, the customers like the changes that we're making in our stores, and we'll continue to look to make a better experience so they continue shopping with us\\nWe continue to make progress on inventory\\nYou've seen more incremental improvements versus, I'd say, the step change improvements we saw last year, and we'll continue to look for improvements we can make in the business\\nI think it's a fair way to look at it, Simeon\\nWell, if you think about Jet, and thanks for bringing that up\\nJet was in the comp for a month, the way our comp calculations work\\nSo there really wasn't much of an impact in the third quarter results\\nReally the way we think about eCommerce is really in total\\nJet is a piece of our eCommerce business overall\\nWe made the decision earlier this year to give more transparency on our U.S\\neCommerce business, and we furthered that in our October meeting, so we'll continue to report on the eCommerce business as a whole\\nIn terms of a glide path, we feel good about the direction of our eCommerce business\\nI think this quarter is another good example of that and we will report that as we go\\nBut in terms of any glide path or volatility, we'll wait and see\\nThank you\\nMaybe I'll give a few comments and turn it over to Kary to give a little more detail\\nSo we'll take the inflation piece first\\nSo the way we've reported inflation on food is really excluding the price investment that we've made and as we got into this quarter we think it's a very \\u2013 it's \\u2013 you talked about what Brett said in his remarks, which is in a similar range or below what we reported which was 30 basis points of inflation in the past quarter\\nThe fact is it's getting a little bit more difficult for us to really be precise with that number as we look at our price investment markets\\nAs we anniversary some of those price investments, it's just becoming a little bit more difficult, so we'll give you as directional as a number as we can to help you analyze that business going forward\\nIn terms of the grocery business or the food business overall specifically, you mentioned online grocery pick up\\nWe know that that's working for our customers\\nWe continue to expand it\\nWe're in 1,100 locations now and expect to add another 1,000 next year\\nSo that's a big initiative for us\\nIt's working and our customers love it\\nIn terms of other things that are working, it's, again, it's a lot of different things\\nIt's expanding assortment, it's quality of product, having in-stocks and price is a component of it as well\\nKary, anything else you want to add?\\nWe won't give the specifics of that\\nIt's working for us based on our rollout plans\\nThanks, Robby\\nAnd I appreciate it\\nSo I think we have to manage labor costs like we manage other expenses in our business\\nOne of the big initiatives that we have is, as we grow the business we want to be more disciplined with our costs\\nWe need to be more efficient\\nWe talked about some of the technology enablers that are helping with that\\nWe have to manage labor costs and we have to look to do that in the most efficient way we can to reach the margin objectives that we have\\nSo that's what we continue to do\\nI think you think about freight just like the other variables that we manage in the business\\nWe have a lot of experience managing the P&L and whether it's labor or freight, we have to pull different levers to deliver on the objective that we have in the freight would be no exception\\nBut I don't have any specifics for you in terms of freight cost increasing\\nRob, next question please?\\nWell, you mentioned the sales piece of it which certainly helped\\nBut it's really about becoming more disciplined with our expenses overall\\nI know we had been talking about that for a while now and it's a big objective of ours going forward\\nThere's not one thing, it's just about being more efficient with the business overall\\nIt's great that we started to see that in the third quarter\\nWe've talked about our goals next year to leverage expenses and we'll continue to push towards that\\nBut it's not one thing, it's a lot\\nThanks, Karen\\nRob, next question please?\\nThanks for your question\\nSo, we continue to execute our pricing strategy that we laid out, I guess, two years ago now\\nThe details of that, and you're not going to be surprised to hear me say that, that we keep pretty close to the vest\\nSo pricing is a piece of what we're doing, along with customer experience and all the other initiatives that we have to grow the top line\\nSo we're not going to give specific details of pricing, but we continue to execute the strategy, and our customers are responding\\nWell, if you think about the Walmart customer base overall, it's actually a pretty good mirror image of the U.S\\npopulation in general\\nWe're pleased with how new customers are using us in multiple ways, and really an omni experience we laid out in our October meeting, that the omni customer certainly spends more with us than single channel customers\\nSo we continue to push that forward\\nIn terms of different age groups or whatnot that are adopting at a faster order, we don't have that particular information\\nBut we continue to move customers into the omni experience at Walmart, to use our brands in different ways\\nWe're expanding our online grocery pick up, almost doubling it next year\\nWe'll continue to do that, because we know that that's where the customer wants to use us in multiple channels, and we'll continue to forge ahead with that\\nWe do quite a bit of research as you would expect, Chuck\\nSo there's a lot of scientific data that we get, now I won't give you a scientific answer\\nThe real \\u2013 I think the nuts and bolts of it is that we think the customers reasonably, I mean, is doing reasonably well\\nWe haven't seen a marked change over the last several quarters, certainly in our results we continue to, I mean, this quarter is a good indication that our initiatives are appealing to the customer, but we don't see a marked change in customers right now\\nThat's really a different product mix and more than anything\\nIn terms of the associate delivery test, we continue to learn from what we're doing\\nIt's certainly an initiative that leverages the unique assets that we have\\nBut not only associate delivery, but ground-based platforms to solve for last mile for really quick delivery for our customers\\nSo we continue to watch that and learn from it\\nAnd nothing you can tell from our fourth quarter guidance of 1.5% to 2% that we feel pretty good about the momentum we have\\nMaybe I'll take the second part of your question first Paul\\nIn terms of the hurricane piece, I think we're as specific as we can be with what we laid out in the quarter with the Walmart U.S\\nbusiness, the 30 to 50 point comp benefit\\nSam's I think was 70 to 90 basis points\\nWe talked about the net of sales and increased cost, gross margin and SG&A to be about $150 million headwind for the U.S\\nbusiness and about $20 million for Sam's\\nSo I think we probably gave as much information as we could from that standpoint\\nIn terms of Sam's overall, I think in the comp piece of it, what I'd point you to more than anything is strong traffic\\nSo a 3.6% member traffic growth\\nWe have members coming in more frequently\\nWe have initiatives like Scan and Go that make it easier for members to come in and shop at clubs\\nAnd that's what I would point you to is traffic up 3.6% in the quarter\\nMatt, it's really the same factors that have driven health and wellness and relatively consistent performance\\nThere was a pick up this quarter as we continue to see script growth in our pharmacy, traffic is very healthy and we also have some new items in over-the-counter that are doing well and some of that obviously is driven by sickness so Cold, Cough & Flu (26:44) was strong this quarter, but branded drug inflation as well is a fact there, but really kind of the same factors that you've heard us talk about over the last couple of quarters, just a bit of a pickup in traffic this quarter\\nI mean, we did see some higher dollar purchases from the GM side\\nSee from a geography standpoint it's SG&A, SG&A overall\\nAnd one thing to point out on the FCPA is, it did drive the quarterly tax rate up\\nSo if you're looking at the year-over-year tax rate, the majority of it was driven by that particular accrual\\nI think the key is to be flexible\\nIf you look at some of the partnerships we've had around the business, I'd point you to JD initially in China, to partner with really one of the largest eCommerce platforms in China, that's where a partnership makes sense\\nYou have brands that we acquired, like Bonobos specifically, that give us really the unique access to great brands like Bonobos that we can leverage to be (29:14) proprietary to our platforms\\nAnd then you have things like Lord & Taylor that you can partner, a capital-light way to bring great brands to your site that we think would work for both parties\\nSo I think the key is to be flexible, and we'll continue to be flexible as we look to build our assortment and give customers more options\\nI think it's tough to dissect and I don't have any, I don't think, useful information, particularly on ladies apparel\\nBut, look, when you have a business of our scale that's growing like we did in the third quarter, I think you're taking share\\nIt's hard to dissect on who from\\nSo I don't really have any color on any specifics on that for you\\nBut thanks for your question, Kate\\nThanks for the question\\nI think it's TBD\\nI think we'll continue to test, learn, and move forward\\nWe have a lot of initiatives underway\\nA lot of you that came to Bentonville last month saw a lot of them, there were things that we're doing in-store that we're excited about\\nSo I think you'll see us test, take some swings, see what works, and expand and fail fast on some initiatives too\\nWe certainly take a look at the competitive environment, that's something we've done at Walmart for a long time\\nSo we continue to do that\\nOur brand is about everyday low prices on baskets of goods, that's where the customers trust our brands for and (32:12) we'll continue to make sure we do that\\nBigger baskets was a piece of it, Scot\\nIt's over 70 million\\nIn the last summer, we gave, I think it was 67 million\\nSo we continue to make progress\\nThank you\\nThanks for your question, Joe\\nAnd we appreciate you notice in the KitchenAid's part of our assortment now and you may have seen that we also have Bose, which is \\u2013 it's a great brand that now is associated with us\\nSo, you worry about that, I think you always watch and learn and we look at the data\\nWe analyze the data really well\\nWe know that customers are looking for premium brands on our website\\nWe think it helps the brand overall\\nSo we'll watch brands like that\\nWe're happy to have them as part of our assortment and we'll continue to learn\\nI think pricing is a piece of it\\nBut I think over the last, call it, at least 12 months maybe closer to 18 months now, there's been an increased focus on getting back to the basics, giving the customer a better experience and we're starting to see some green shoots there\\nThanks, guys\\nWe don't have any more questions in the queue\\nSo I just wanted to thank everyone for their time, for your interest in Walmart and happy holidays\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Stock_Ticker\",\n

Before I walk through the announcements for the quarter and the revised outlook, let's turn to slide four, and I will walk quickly through the headline numbers\\nSales and revenues of $11.3 billion were up about 10% from the second quarter of last year\\nWhile many of our end markets are far off previous peaks, we are starting to see several markets recover, and demand for China construction and North America gas compressions remain strong\\nSales were higher in all three primary product segments, led by Construction Industries, followed by Resource Industries, and then Energy and Transportation\\nProfit per share was up $0.42 from $0.93 to $1.35. We continued to execute on our restructuring plan which includes the closure and consolidation of more than 30 facilities\\nThese actions are important to achieving the flexible cost structure required to remain profitable through the cycles\\nAt the same time, we are thoughtfully preserving the capacity needed to meet future growth needs\\nAs a result of restructuring actions, we incurred $169 million in restructuring costs in the quarter, $30 million more than in the second quarter of 2016. In the quarter, we also recognized a pre-tax gain of $85 million on the sale of our investment in IronPlanet\\nAdjusted profit per share was up $0.40 from $1.09 in the second quarter of 2016 to $1.49. Higher sales, including a favorable mix, were the primary drivers of the profit improvement\\nImproved price on lower variable manufacturing costs were about offset by higher period cost due to an increase to the short-term incentive compensation accrual that resulted from the upward revision to the outlook\\nNow let's turn to slide five\\nSecond quarter operating profit was $1.251 billion as compared with $785 million in 2016, up $466 million\\nOperating profit pull-through in the quarter was nearly 50%\\nPositive changes to operating profit came from several areas\\nThe largest increase to profit was a result of higher sales volume and favorable mix\\nAll four geographic regions and all three primary product segments saw higher sales and revenues\\nHowever, increases to sales and revenues were largely concentrated in four end markets\\nChina construction and North America gas compression continued to experience strength, and robust overhaul and maintenance activity drove higher aftermarket parts sales for both mining and well servicing equipment\\nPrice improved $183 million in the quarter\\nThe favorable change was largely due to Construction Industries as Resource Industries and Energy and Transportation price realization were about flat\\nVariable manufacturing costs were favorable $44 million, largely due to the favorable impact of period cost absorbed as inventories increased in the quarter in many of our factories to support higher production\\nAs we ramp up production, we remain focused on lean principles, and we are working diligently to bring production up quickly but also efficiently\\nMaterial costs were about flat in the quarter\\nWhile our design and procurement teams continue to work on projects to lower material costs through redesign and resourcing, we expect higher steel cost to put pressure on material cost in the second half\\nSo while period costs were higher by $237 million, in the quarter we accrued about $330 million more short-term incentive compensation for ME&T than the second quarter of last year\\nWhen exclude the higher STIP accrual, period costs were lower by about $80 million driven by restructuring and cost reduction actions over the past year that are focused on lowering the company's embedded cost structure\\nAs we have weathered through the challenges of the last few years, maintaining a strong balance sheet has been a priority and we are continuing that focus\\nME&T operating cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and is $3.6 billion year-to-date, both well above prior year comparables\\nME&T debt-to-cap at the end of the quarter was 38.6%, well within our targeted range\\nWe ended the quarter with $10.2 billion in enterprise cash, and in June the board approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend which we expect will make 2017 the 24th year in a row of paying higher dividends to our shareholders\\nNow let's move on to discuss each of the segments, and we'll start with slide six\\nConstruction Industry sales were up 11% to $4.9 billion\\nHigher sales volume to Asia Pacific and Latin America and favorable price realization contributed to the increase\\nMost of the sales increase in the quarter for Construction Industries was driven by what has continued to be strong end user demand in China for construction equipment, most notably excavators\\nThrough the first half of the year, the 10 ton and above excavator industry in China was up about 130% from last year\\nStrength in China continues to be driven by government support for infrastructure and strong residential investment\\nSales in China in the second quarter were better than we had expected, and we now expect demand in China to remain strong through the rest of the year\\nIf you look at the chart at the top of the right-hand side of slide six, it shows China industry sales for 10 ton and above sized excavators from 2006 through 2017 forecast\\nYou can see from the chart that while demand for 10 ton and above excavators is up significantly versus the last two years, it is still far below highs achieved earlier this decade\\nContinued strength in China is dependent on underlying demand, government support and accommodating credit conditions For Latin America, sales were higher due to an increase in end user demand across several South American countries as well as favorable dealer inventory changes\\nWhile we saw some regions improve in the quarter, Latin America, especially Brazil, remained challenged, and sales are still at very low levels\\nNorth America sales to end users were up and price realization improved\\nHowever, these were mostly offset by a drop in dealer inventory\\nNorth America dealers typically pull from inventory in the second quarter to support the strong selling season\\nHowever, this year the reduction in dealer inventory drawdown was greater than last year, resulting in an unfavorable impact to sale\\nAs you can see in the chart on the bottom right-hand side of the slide, higher end user demand in North America was primarily driven by improved residential and non-residential construction\\nAs the chart also shows, infrastructure spend in the U.S\\nhas been stagnant for some time, and sales of construction equipment for infrastructure projects was down in the quarter as we have yet to see federal, state and local funding for road projects translate into higher sales\\nThe United States is in need of infrastructure investment\\nPassage of a federal infrastructure bill would be positive for our country and our business\\nAs expected, in the middle of the spring and summer selling season, the backlog for construction industries was down from the first quarter of 2017. However, the decrease this quarter of about $300 million was less than the first quarter to second quarter reductions in both 2015 and 2016 when the backlog went down by $1 billion and $900 million respectively\\nOrder rates were strong in the quarter with all regions seeing an improvement from year ago\\nLet's move to slide seven\\nConstruction Industries segment profit was favorable by about $350 million driven by favorable price realization and higher sales volume, including a favorable mix of products\\nPeriod costs were about flat as higher short-term incentive compensation expense was largely offset by restructuring and cost reduction actions\\nConstruction Industries was an early adopter of our operating and execution model, and this focus has helped to improve their segment profitability\\nSegment profit margin in the quarter was 18.2%, an increase of almost 600 basis points from the second quarter of last year\\nLet's move to slide eight and Resource Industries\\nContinued strong demand for after-market parts to support overhauls and maintenance work combined with favorable changes to dealer inventories were the primary drivers of the $300 million increase in sales and revenues for Resource Industries; an increase of 21%\\nIn order to call a recovery in mining, we have said that first the excess machine inventory in the mines would need to be worked off\\nThen demand for overhauls and maintenance would drive higher aftermarket part sales\\nAnd last, orders for new equipment would start to increase\\nThe cycle is starting to play out\\nUtilization on trucks is up 4% from last year\\nThe part fleet continues to come down, and for the fifth quarter in a row, part sales have increased to support rebuild and maintenance needs as well as higher utilization of fleets in the mines\\nAnd our order rates are improving\\nAfter four years of dealers reducing their inventories, for the second sequential quarter, dealer inventory held about flat\\nSales increases and favorable dealer inventory changes were broad based across all regions\\nAs you saw in the sales to user numbers that were released yesterday, RI sales to users were about flat in the quarter\\nHowever, we believe sales to users are a lagging indicator of industry trend\\nOrder rates in the quarter were up more than double the second quarter of last year\\nThe backlog for Resource Industries was up about $300 million from the end of the first quarter 2017, and Resource Industries was a significant part of the $3 billion increase in the backlog since the second quarter of last year\\nHowever, while Resource Industries has started to recover, sales volumes remain at historically low level\\nWe'll move to slide nine and look at their operating performance\\nOn improving sales with a focus on operational performance, Resource Industries delivered a solid quarter\\nSegment profit was $97 million, up $260 million from a loss of $163 million in 2016. The improvement in profit resulted from higher sales volume, including a favorable mix of products and lower period cost\\nResource Industries continues to implement a number of restructuring actions to lower their breakeven point\\nThese initiatives enabled them to deliver lower period cost in the quarter even after recognizing a large increase in short-term incentive compensation expense\\nResource Industries incurred additional warranty expense of a little over $50 million in the quarter for a customer program we do not expect to repeat\\nNext we'll go through Energy and Transportation on slide ten\\nSales were up $200 million or 5% in the quarter to $3.9 billion\\nHigher sales into oil and gas combined with higher industrial aftermarket sales were the primary drivers of the sales increase\\nSales into power generation were about flat as a slight improvement in North America was mostly offset by weaknesses in other regions\\nTransportation sales decreased, largely due to lower demand for marine application\\nSales into the rail industry were about flat\\nWhile the rail industry remains weak and the number of stored locomotives remains elevated, this was mostly offset in the quarter by an increase in rail services to support higher rail traffic\\nThe chart on the right side of slide 10 shows the four-year history of U.S\\nrig counts and west Texas intermediate oil prices\\nThe number of rigs in production has doubled from recent lows reached in May of 2016. U.S\\noil production has increased accordingly\\nIn the areas where we participate in the oil and gas market, the recent strength has largely been concentrated to well servicing and midstream gas compression applications\\nDemand for aftermarket parts to support overhaul and maintenance of well servicing fleets increased in the quarter, primarily to support rigs that are going back to work in the Permian Basin and other shale formations in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico where the cost of production and transportation is low enough to encourage investment despite recent oil price volatility\\nMidstream gas compression is having another good year as we support the continued buildout of North America's natural gas infrastructure\\nIn addition, recent developments in the Permian in the last 12 months have had a higher concentration of natural gas than previous wells\\nThis discovery has contributed to a higher demand for 3500 and 3600 reciprocating engines to support the midstream gas compression growth in that region\\nWe move to slide 11; we'll look at the segment for Energy and Transportation\\nEnergy and Transportation profit was up $98 million from $602 million to $700 million\\nThis was largely attributable to higher sales volume, a favorable impact from cost absorption and improved material cost\\nPeriod cost increased in the quarter but were about flat after excluding higher short term incentive compensation expense\\nBefore I move on to the outlook, a quick comment on financial products\\nOperating profit was down slightly due to the absence of the sale of securities at Cat Insurance Services\\nThe portfolio remains healthy with past dues down 22 basis points in the second quarter of 2016 and write-offs were down $7 million\\nUsed equipment prices continued to improve which helped, and the team delivered a solid quarter\\nWe'll move to slide 12, and we'll cover the outlook\\nWe announced this morning that we are raising the outlook for full year sales and revenues and profit per share\\nIn April we provided an outlook for sales and revenues of $38 billion to $41 billion\\nAs a result of strong operational performance in the first half, encouraging order rate, good economic indicators and a solid backlog, we are providing new guidance for sales and revenues in the range of $42 billion to $44 billion with a midpoint of $43 billion, up $3.5 billion from the prior outlook\\nAt the midpoint of the sales and revenues range, we have raised the profit per share outlook to $3.50 per share and raised the adjusted profit per share outlook from $3.75 to $5. We'll move on to slide 13 and cover the sales outlook by segment\\nWe now expect Construction Industries sales for the year to be up 10% to 15% versus the previous outlook of flat to up 5%\\nThis is driven largely by higher end user demand in both China and North America\\nOrder rates for Construction Industries have been strong through the first half of the year across most regions with an exception of the Middle East and Brazil which remain challenged\\nThe backlog is also up significantly from the second quarter of 2016. We do expect sales in the second half of the year to be slightly lower than the first half\\nFor Construction Industries, the second quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year as construction activity and deliveries pick up to support the spring and summer construction season in the Northern Hemisphere\\nFewer workdays due to holidays and vacations combined with the anticipation of colder weather typically drives sales lower in the second half\\nIn China, on average for the last five years, over 55% of sales were realized in the first half of the year\\nFor Resource Industries, we now expect sales to be up 20% to 25% for the full year versus the previous outlook of up 10% to 15%\\nWhile we expect aftermarket part sales to remain strong through the rest of the year as the number of parked trucks is reduced and the demand for overhauls declines, we expect the rate of growth to slow, and for part sales to be lower in the second half than the first\\nHowever, we expect this will be more than offset by an increase in new equipment sales\\nEnergy and Transportation sales are forecasted to be up 5% to 10% for the year versus the previous outlook of about flat\\nWe continue to see strong rebuild activity in well servicing for engines, transmission, pumps, and flow iron, and new equipment deliveries are expected to increase in the second half of the year\\nWe also expect shipments to North America gas compression customers to be higher in the second half\\nIndustrial, power generation and transportation are all expected to be about flat to slightly up\\nWe move to slide 14. At the midpoint of the sales and revenue range, the new outlook for profit per share is $3.50 and the revised outlook for adjusted profit per share is $5. The increase in the profit outlook since April is largely the result of the improved forecast for sales and revenues and disciplined cost control partially offset by an increase in short term incentive compensation expense\\nAs compared to 2016 at the midpoint of the range, the revised outlook reflects higher sales and revenues of about $4.5 billion or 12%, and an increase in adjusted profit per share of $1.58. The increase in adjusted profit per share versus 2016 is largely driven by higher sales volume of $4.5 billion and the associated margin on those sales\\nFavorable price, while we do not expect the same level of price favorability in the second half of the year, we still expect favorable price realization for the full year in a range of 0.5% to 1%\\nFavorable impact from period cost absorbed as inventories are expected to increase to support higher production level\\nThese favorable items will be partially offset by higher short term incentive compensation expense of about $1 billion\\nMaterial costs are now expected to be about flat for the full year\\nWhile geopolitical uncertainty and commodity volatility continue to be risks to the outlook, our outlook assumes that oil prices remain bound within the recent range of volatility, markets stay resilient to geopolitical uncertainties, and China remains supportive of growth\\nHowever, changes to any of these variables as well as others could impact our sales and revenues outlook for the full year\\nWe'll turn to slide 15 and wrap up\\nOperational performance for the year has been strong with second quarter operating profit pull-through of nearly 50%\\nWhile a number of our end markets remain challenged, we see strong demand in deliveries for China construction and North America gas compression equipment\\nAnd demand for aftermarket parts has increased to support overhaul and maintenance activity for well servicing, gas compression, and mining equipment\\nOrders and end user demand for North American construction equipment also improved in the quarter\\nWe continue to be focused on lean, product quality, and investing in the business for future growth\\nThe balance sheet remains strong, and we delivered $2 billion in ME&T operating cash flow in the quarter\\nGiven year to date performance and our confidence in the second half of the year, we are raising the outlook for both sales and revenues and profit per share\\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Amy\\nAnn, this is Brad Halverson\\nMaybe just another comment about how we use that language\\nWe use that language because that's how we're operating internally\\nWe have now been through four years of a downturn\\nIt's been hard on us\\nWe've taken significant restructuring activities and we like where our cost structure is at and where our balance sheet is at\\nAnd so using our operating and execution model, Jim is really driving continued focus on cost reduction across the support areas, and as we increase period cost, you'll see that there'll be very targeted in areas that offer the most long term value for the company consistent with kind of the pools of OPACC we see out there in the future\\nAnd this is a little example in the second half of this year where we're going to take an opportunity to do a little bit of that where we think there's a lot of value and keep the lid on the other costs that we have in the company\\nYeah, I'd say, Ann, actually I think not because this time I've been in a career here at Cat a long time\\nTypically, we have reductions in areas that are easy to find\\nSo we reduce R&D or reduce other things\\nIn this downturn, if you look at our cost reduction, it's been highly targeted to areas that are not kind of future value\\nThey're areas of efficiency and consolidation and support cost\\nWe have really increased spending in many of the growth areas\\nWe've protected R&D by and large, and we've protected things like digital spending\\nSo we've taken an entirely different approach in this downturn in terms of where we took cost out and what cost we protected\\nSo I would say it's different than we would have historically done\",\n          \"Good morning, everyone\\nLet me start with the headlines for the quarter\\nSales and earnings were down slightly, reflecting a challenging environment, as Tom just described, and comparison to strong results last year\\nWe delivered significant cost savings in the quarter, and we've increased our full year cost savings outlook\\nAnd finally, we're on track with our overall capital plan\\nNow let's take a look at the details, starting with sales\\nOur second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, that's down 1% year-on-year due to lower organic sales\\nTom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes\\nOn profitability, second quarter gross margin was 36.1%, that's down 20 basis points year-on-year\\nOperating margin was 17.5%, down 50 basis points\\nWhile margins were down slightly overall, I'm encouraged with the improvements that we achieved in our Personal Care and K-C Professional business segments, and also in the developing and emerging markets overall\\nCommodities were a $75 million drag in the second quarter, and for the full year, we're now expecting inflation of $200 million to $300 million, that's $50 million higher than our previous estimate driven by higher pulp costs\\nOur teams continued to deliver significant FORCE cost savings\\nSecond quarter savings were $120 million and we've increased our full year savings target to $425 million to $450 million\\nOur original target was for savings of at least $400 million\\nGiven the current environment, we are also tightly managing our overhead spending\\nOn the bottom line, second quarter earnings per share were $1.49, down 3% year-on-year\\nLower equity income reduced earnings by $0.03 per share, offset by a lower share count and a slightly better effective tax rate\\nNow let's take a look at cash flow\\nCash provided by operations in the second quarter was $825 million, in line with our expectations\\nCash flow was down compared to $860 million in the year-ago quarter, including the impact of higher tax payments this year\\nSecond quarter working capital cash conversion cycle was down six days compared to full year 2016, bringing the year-to-date decline to five days\\nWe're making very good progress in this area, and we expect to nicely exceed our original one-day improvement target for the full year\\nWe also continue to manage capital spending in this environment, and we now expect that full year spending will be in the lower half of our $850 million to $950 million target range\\nOn capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $600 million\\nWe continue to expect that full year dividends and share repurchases will total between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion\\nLooking at our segments, in Personal Care, organic sales fell 1% due to lower net selling prices\\nOrganic sales were up 2% in developing and emerging markets but were down elsewhere\\nPersonal Care operating margins were 20.6%, up 60 basis points\\nThe improvement was driven by cost savings, partially offset by lower selling prices and higher input costs\\nIn Consumer Tissue, organic sales were down 2%, driven by North America\\nOverall, Consumer Tissue operating margins were 16.5%, down 190 basis points\\nThe results were impacted by lower sales and higher pulp costs\\nIn K-C Professional, organic sales in the quarter were up 1%, with gains in all major geographies\\nK-C Professional operating margins were 20.1%, up 150 basis points\\nThe comparison included benefits from cost savings\\nSo in summary, our second quarter results were impacted by difficult environment with weaker economies, category softness and increased competitive activity\\nNonetheless, we are achieving strong cost savings, we're generating healthy cash flow, and we're allocating capital in shareholder-friendly ways\\nI'll now turn the call back over to Tom\\nYeah, we do continue to deliver significant cost savings through the FORCE program, and we were able to take up the full year target\\nAnd what I'd say is that as the program name implies, our teams really are Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere\\nWhen you look at our supply chain savings that includes improving productivity and waste across our manufacturing operations, driving down the cost of our facilities, optimizing the cost of our product specifications and continually negotiating lower input costs or material costs of our products\\nAnd year-to-date, we are at 4% of cost of goods, which is really a strong performance, not only internally but benchmarks very well\\nI continue to see opportunities for us to continue to deliver the FORCE cost savings as we move forward\\nSo good performance there, and I think more opportunity there\\nSure\\nOn the buyback, the $800 million to $1 billion is still the right number for the year\\nWe're on track with that\\nAnd in terms of the interest expense, we did some pre-funding on the $950 million that comes due in August, which is why you see a higher debt number at the end of the quarter, but that should normalize\\nAnd the debt that we'll take out in August is a pretty high coupon, it's 6.125%, and so that will be replaced with lower interest rate debt and that should bring the interest expense down for the year\",\n          \"Thanks, Rob\\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Walmart's investor relations call to discuss third quarter earnings\\nThis is Steve Schmitt, and I'm joined today by, Kary Brunner, Michael Brigance, Joey Smith, and Miguel Garcia from the IR team\\nHopefully, you've seen our materials we issued this morning\\nI'm going to hit on a couple of key points in a minute, and then we'll open the call for Q&A\\nThere will be forward-looking statements on today's call, which are subject to future events and uncertainties\\nActual results could differ materially from these statements\\nPlease review the full Safe Harbor statement accompanying our earnings materials\\nSo let me talk about a few highlights in the quarter\\nWe had a really strong quarter\\nWe have broad-based growth\\nOn a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales were up 3.8%, an increase of $4.5 billion\\nWe delivered adjusted EPS of $1. You notice our GAAP EPS was $0.58 a share\\nSo we adjusted GAAP EPS for three items that are detailed in the release, I'll hit on the three of them\\nWe recently completed a debt tender offer\\nWe made an FCPA accrual regarding possible resolution of the FCPA matter\\nWe made the exit of certain properties in one of our international markets\\nSo excluding these items, our adjusted EPS was $1. We have good momentum in sales growth across the business\\ncomp sales growth was 2.7%, with comp traffic up 1.5%\\nWe saw about a 30 to 50 point positive impact to the comp from recent hurricanes\\nOur Walmart U.S\\neCommerce sales grew 50%\\nSam's comp sales grew 2.8% led by traffic and also had a benefit from the hurricanes\\nInternational delivered another solid quarter with 10 of 11 markets reporting positive comp sales\\nExcluding the charge for the FCPA accrual we disclosed today, we would have leveraged expenses as a company in the quarter, which has been a point of emphasis for us\\nWe're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.38 to $4.46, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $4.30 to $4.40. Fourth quarter Walmart U.S\\ncomp sales are expected to increase between 1.5% and 2% on more difficult compares\\nJust a couple of reminders\\nWe'll release our fourth quarter earnings on February 20, 2018. And like to let everyone know that next year's earnings release dates will be posted to our website\\nSo please mark your calendars for that\\nAnd at this point, we'd be happy to take your questions\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nThanks, Michael\\nLet me talk about maybe two things; gross margin on a consolidated basis, and then on a U.S\\nbasis\\nSo on a consolidated basis, gross profit rate declined 29 basis points\\nAnd you hit on several of the items, so on a consolidated basis, we have price investments in certain markets, mix effects of eCommerce, which you mentioned, and keep in mind the U.S\\nhurricane-related expenses that we had\\nI'd also like to point your attention to operating margin and some of the things that just we'd like you to pay attention to, as we called out some items such as the FCPA accrual, international impairments, and hurricane impacts\\nSo just keep these in mind when you're looking at overall operating profit performance in the quarter\\nFor Walmart U.S\\nspecifically, gross profit margin declined 36 basis points in the quarter\\nPrice investments, as you mentioned, mix effects of eCommerce impacted as well\\nAnd the hurricane specifically, we estimate impacted the gross profit decline of about a third of that\\nSo I'm not getting into all the details specifically, we continue to invest in price\\nWe're operating with more discipline, and we'll continue to look ways to manage our margin, and ways that work for our customers and work for our shareholders\\nIt's really the productivity beginning to turn for us\\nSo you could see gross profit margin pressure from time-to-time, and we need to get more disciplined with expenses\\nSo if you think about our business, and certainly our DNA, we're about offering everyday low prices, both in-store and online\\nThe fact is, some products are just cheaper to sell in stores, think about items like bottled water, so you'll see some price differences from time-to-time\\nThanks, Oliver\\nSo the first question around smart cart technology\\nIt's something that we continue to look at\\nWe need to be thoughtful about it as we think about putting that potentially on Walmart\\ncom, but nothing really more to add at this time\\nIn terms of the Lord & Taylor relationship, it's going to be a unique experience\\nThink about it as a flagship store\\nThis is expected to launch in the spring\\nIt will be dedicated store on Walmart\\nWe're excited about the relationship, the deep relationships Lord & Taylor has with great brands, and we know our customers look for premium brands on our site\\nSo we think it's a good agreement, and we look forward to the spring\\nWell, I think there's a lot of things\\nIf you talk to Greg Foran, the CEO of our U.S\\nbusiness, he could probably list a list of 20 to 30, maybe even more than that, from the time the customer walks in the door to the time they check out, from a booking standpoint\\nSo, we continue to look at it\\nI think you can tell in our results, the customers like the changes that we're making in our stores, and we'll continue to look to make a better experience so they continue shopping with us\\nWe continue to make progress on inventory\\nYou've seen more incremental improvements versus, I'd say, the step change improvements we saw last year, and we'll continue to look for improvements we can make in the business\\nI think it's a fair way to look at it, Simeon\\nWell, if you think about Jet, and thanks for bringing that up\\nJet was in the comp for a month, the way our comp calculations work\\nSo there really wasn't much of an impact in the third quarter results\\nReally the way we think about eCommerce is really in total\\nJet is a piece of our eCommerce business overall\\nWe made the decision earlier this year to give more transparency on our U.S\\neCommerce business, and we furthered that in our October meeting, so we'll continue to report on the eCommerce business as a whole\\nIn terms of a glide path, we feel good about the direction of our eCommerce business\\nI think this quarter is another good example of that and we will report that as we go\\nBut in terms of any glide path or volatility, we'll wait and see\\nThank you\\nMaybe I'll give a few comments and turn it over to Kary to give a little more detail\\nSo we'll take the inflation piece first\\nSo the way we've reported inflation on food is really excluding the price investment that we've made and as we got into this quarter we think it's a very \\u2013 it's \\u2013 you talked about what Brett said in his remarks, which is in a similar range or below what we reported which was 30 basis points of inflation in the past quarter\\nThe fact is it's getting a little bit more difficult for us to really be precise with that number as we look at our price investment markets\\nAs we anniversary some of those price investments, it's just becoming a little bit more difficult, so we'll give you as directional as a number as we can to help you analyze that business going forward\\nIn terms of the grocery business or the food business overall specifically, you mentioned online grocery pick up\\nWe know that that's working for our customers\\nWe continue to expand it\\nWe're in 1,100 locations now and expect to add another 1,000 next year\\nSo that's a big initiative for us\\nIt's working and our customers love it\\nIn terms of other things that are working, it's, again, it's a lot of different things\\nIt's expanding assortment, it's quality of product, having in-stocks and price is a component of it as well\\nKary, anything else you want to add?\\nWe won't give the specifics of that\\nIt's working for us based on our rollout plans\\nThanks, Robby\\nAnd I appreciate it\\nSo I think we have to manage labor costs like we manage other expenses in our business\\nOne of the big initiatives that we have is, as we grow the business we want to be more disciplined with our costs\\nWe need to be more efficient\\nWe talked about some of the technology enablers that are helping with that\\nWe have to manage labor costs and we have to look to do that in the most efficient way we can to reach the margin objectives that we have\\nSo that's what we continue to do\\nI think you think about freight just like the other variables that we manage in the business\\nWe have a lot of experience managing the P&L and whether it's labor or freight, we have to pull different levers to deliver on the objective that we have in the freight would be no exception\\nBut I don't have any specifics for you in terms of freight cost increasing\\nRob, next question please?\\nWell, you mentioned the sales piece of it which certainly helped\\nBut it's really about becoming more disciplined with our expenses overall\\nI know we had been talking about that for a while now and it's a big objective of ours going forward\\nThere's not one thing, it's just about being more efficient with the business overall\\nIt's great that we started to see that in the third quarter\\nWe've talked about our goals next year to leverage expenses and we'll continue to push towards that\\nBut it's not one thing, it's a lot\\nThanks, Karen\\nRob, next question please?\\nThanks for your question\\nSo, we continue to execute our pricing strategy that we laid out, I guess, two years ago now\\nThe details of that, and you're not going to be surprised to hear me say that, that we keep pretty close to the vest\\nSo pricing is a piece of what we're doing, along with customer experience and all the other initiatives that we have to grow the top line\\nSo we're not going to give specific details of pricing, but we continue to execute the strategy, and our customers are responding\\nWell, if you think about the Walmart customer base overall, it's actually a pretty good mirror image of the U.S\\npopulation in general\\nWe're pleased with how new customers are using us in multiple ways, and really an omni experience we laid out in our October meeting, that the omni customer certainly spends more with us than single channel customers\\nSo we continue to push that forward\\nIn terms of different age groups or whatnot that are adopting at a faster order, we don't have that particular information\\nBut we continue to move customers into the omni experience at Walmart, to use our brands in different ways\\nWe're expanding our online grocery pick up, almost doubling it next year\\nWe'll continue to do that, because we know that that's where the customer wants to use us in multiple channels, and we'll continue to forge ahead with that\\nWe do quite a bit of research as you would expect, Chuck\\nSo there's a lot of scientific data that we get, now I won't give you a scientific answer\\nThe real \\u2013 I think the nuts and bolts of it is that we think the customers reasonably, I mean, is doing reasonably well\\nWe haven't seen a marked change over the last several quarters, certainly in our results we continue to, I mean, this quarter is a good indication that our initiatives are appealing to the customer, but we don't see a marked change in customers right now\\nThat's really a different product mix and more than anything\\nIn terms of the associate delivery test, we continue to learn from what we're doing\\nIt's certainly an initiative that leverages the unique assets that we have\\nBut not only associate delivery, but ground-based platforms to solve for last mile for really quick delivery for our customers\\nSo we continue to watch that and learn from it\\nAnd nothing you can tell from our fourth quarter guidance of 1.5% to 2% that we feel pretty good about the momentum we have\\nMaybe I'll take the second part of your question first Paul\\nIn terms of the hurricane piece, I think we're as specific as we can be with what we laid out in the quarter with the Walmart U.S\\nbusiness, the 30 to 50 point comp benefit\\nSam's I think was 70 to 90 basis points\\nWe talked about the net of sales and increased cost, gross margin and SG&A to be about $150 million headwind for the U.S\\nbusiness and about $20 million for Sam's\\nSo I think we probably gave as much information as we could from that standpoint\\nIn terms of Sam's overall, I think in the comp piece of it, what I'd point you to more than anything is strong traffic\\nSo a 3.6% member traffic growth\\nWe have members coming in more frequently\\nWe have initiatives like Scan and Go that make it easier for members to come in and shop at clubs\\nAnd that's what I would point you to is traffic up 3.6% in the quarter\\nMatt, it's really the same factors that have driven health and wellness and relatively consistent performance\\nThere was a pick up this quarter as we continue to see script growth in our pharmacy, traffic is very healthy and we also have some new items in over-the-counter that are doing well and some of that obviously is driven by sickness so Cold, Cough & Flu (26:44) was strong this quarter, but branded drug inflation as well is a fact there, but really kind of the same factors that you've heard us talk about over the last couple of quarters, just a bit of a pickup in traffic this quarter\\nI mean, we did see some higher dollar purchases from the GM side\\nSee from a geography standpoint it's SG&A, SG&A overall\\nAnd one thing to point out on the FCPA is, it did drive the quarterly tax rate up\\nSo if you're looking at the year-over-year tax rate, the majority of it was driven by that particular accrual\\nI think the key is to be flexible\\nIf you look at some of the partnerships we've had around the business, I'd point you to JD initially in China, to partner with really one of the largest eCommerce platforms in China, that's where a partnership makes sense\\nYou have brands that we acquired, like Bonobos specifically, that give us really the unique access to great brands like Bonobos that we can leverage to be (29:14) proprietary to our platforms\\nAnd then you have things like Lord & Taylor that you can partner, a capital-light way to bring great brands to your site that we think would work for both parties\\nSo I think the key is to be flexible, and we'll continue to be flexible as we look to build our assortment and give customers more options\\nI think it's tough to dissect and I don't have any, I don't think, useful information, particularly on ladies apparel\\nBut, look, when you have a business of our scale that's growing like we did in the third quarter, I think you're taking share\\nIt's hard to dissect on who from\\nSo I don't really have any color on any specifics on that for you\\nBut thanks for your question, Kate\\nThanks for the question\\nI think it's TBD\\nI think we'll continue to test, learn, and move forward\\nWe have a lot of initiatives underway\\nA lot of you that came to Bentonville last month saw a lot of them, there were things that we're doing in-store that we're excited about\\nSo I think you'll see us test, take some swings, see what works, and expand and fail fast on some initiatives too\\nWe certainly take a look at the competitive environment, that's something we've done at Walmart for a long time\\nSo we continue to do that\\nOur brand is about everyday low prices on baskets of goods, that's where the customers trust our brands for and (32:12) we'll continue to make sure we do that\\nBigger baskets was a piece of it, Scot\\nIt's over 70 million\\nIn the last summer, we gave, I think it was 67 million\\nSo we continue to make progress\\nThank you\\nThanks for your question, Joe\\nAnd we appreciate you notice in the KitchenAid's part of our assortment now and you may have seen that we also have Bose, which is \\u2013 it's a great brand that now is associated with us\\nSo, you worry about that, I think you always watch and learn and we look at the data\\nWe analyze the data really well\\nWe know that customers are looking for premium brands on our website\\nWe think it helps the brand overall\\nSo we'll watch brands like that\\nWe're happy to have them as part of our assortment and we'll continue to learn\\nI think pricing is a piece of it\\nBut I think over the last, call it, at least 12 months maybe closer to 18 months now, there's been an increased focus on getting back to the basics, giving the customer a better experience and we're starting to see some green shoots there\\nThanks, guys\\nWe don't have any more questions in the queue\\nSo I just wanted to thank everyone for their time, for your interest in Walmart and happy holidays\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Stock_Ticker\",\n

Before I walk through the announcements for the quarter and the revised outlook, let's turn to slide four, and I will walk quickly through the headline numbers\\nSales and revenues of $11.3 billion were up about 10% from the second quarter of last year\\nWhile many of our end markets are far off previous peaks, we are starting to see several markets recover, and demand for China construction and North America gas compressions remain strong\\nSales were higher in all three primary product segments, led by Construction Industries, followed by Resource Industries, and then Energy and Transportation\\nProfit per share was up $0.42 from $0.93 to $1.35. We continued to execute on our restructuring plan which includes the closure and consolidation of more than 30 facilities\\nThese actions are important to achieving the flexible cost structure required to remain profitable through the cycles\\nAt the same time, we are thoughtfully preserving the capacity needed to meet future growth needs\\nAs a result of restructuring actions, we incurred $169 million in restructuring costs in the quarter, $30 million more than in the second quarter of 2016. In the quarter, we also recognized a pre-tax gain of $85 million on the sale of our investment in IronPlanet\\nAdjusted profit per share was up $0.40 from $1.09 in the second quarter of 2016 to $1.49. Higher sales, including a favorable mix, were the primary drivers of the profit improvement\\nImproved price on lower variable manufacturing costs were about offset by higher period cost due to an increase to the short-term incentive compensation accrual that resulted from the upward revision to the outlook\\nNow let's turn to slide five\\nSecond quarter operating profit was $1.251 billion as compared with $785 million in 2016, up $466 million\\nOperating profit pull-through in the quarter was nearly 50%\\nPositive changes to operating profit came from several areas\\nThe largest increase to profit was a result of higher sales volume and favorable mix\\nAll four geographic regions and all three primary product segments saw higher sales and revenues\\nHowever, increases to sales and revenues were largely concentrated in four end markets\\nChina construction and North America gas compression continued to experience strength, and robust overhaul and maintenance activity drove higher aftermarket parts sales for both mining and well servicing equipment\\nPrice improved $183 million in the quarter\\nThe favorable change was largely due to Construction Industries as Resource Industries and Energy and Transportation price realization were about flat\\nVariable manufacturing costs were favorable $44 million, largely due to the favorable impact of period cost absorbed as inventories increased in the quarter in many of our factories to support higher production\\nAs we ramp up production, we remain focused on lean principles, and we are working diligently to bring production up quickly but also efficiently\\nMaterial costs were about flat in the quarter\\nWhile our design and procurement teams continue to work on projects to lower material costs through redesign and resourcing, we expect higher steel cost to put pressure on material cost in the second half\\nSo while period costs were higher by $237 million, in the quarter we accrued about $330 million more short-term incentive compensation for ME&T than the second quarter of last year\\nWhen exclude the higher STIP accrual, period costs were lower by about $80 million driven by restructuring and cost reduction actions over the past year that are focused on lowering the company's embedded cost structure\\nAs we have weathered through the challenges of the last few years, maintaining a strong balance sheet has been a priority and we are continuing that focus\\nME&T operating cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and is $3.6 billion year-to-date, both well above prior year comparables\\nME&T debt-to-cap at the end of the quarter was 38.6%, well within our targeted range\\nWe ended the quarter with $10.2 billion in enterprise cash, and in June the board approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend which we expect will make 2017 the 24th year in a row of paying higher dividends to our shareholders\\nNow let's move on to discuss each of the segments, and we'll start with slide six\\nConstruction Industry sales were up 11% to $4.9 billion\\nHigher sales volume to Asia Pacific and Latin America and favorable price realization contributed to the increase\\nMost of the sales increase in the quarter for Construction Industries was driven by what has continued to be strong end user demand in China for construction equipment, most notably excavators\\nThrough the first half of the year, the 10 ton and above excavator industry in China was up about 130% from last year\\nStrength in China continues to be driven by government support for infrastructure and strong residential investment\\nSales in China in the second quarter were better than we had expected, and we now expect demand in China to remain strong through the rest of the year\\nIf you look at the chart at the top of the right-hand side of slide six, it shows China industry sales for 10 ton and above sized excavators from 2006 through 2017 forecast\\nYou can see from the chart that while demand for 10 ton and above excavators is up significantly versus the last two years, it is still far below highs achieved earlier this decade\\nContinued strength in China is dependent on underlying demand, government support and accommodating credit conditions For Latin America, sales were higher due to an increase in end user demand across several South American countries as well as favorable dealer inventory changes\\nWhile we saw some regions improve in the quarter, Latin America, especially Brazil, remained challenged, and sales are still at very low levels\\nNorth America sales to end users were up and price realization improved\\nHowever, these were mostly offset by a drop in dealer inventory\\nNorth America dealers typically pull from inventory in the second quarter to support the strong selling season\\nHowever, this year the reduction in dealer inventory drawdown was greater than last year, resulting in an unfavorable impact to sale\\nAs you can see in the chart on the bottom right-hand side of the slide, higher end user demand in North America was primarily driven by improved residential and non-residential construction\\nAs the chart also shows, infrastructure spend in the U.S\\nhas been stagnant for some time, and sales of construction equipment for infrastructure projects was down in the quarter as we have yet to see federal, state and local funding for road projects translate into higher sales\\nThe United States is in need of infrastructure investment\\nPassage of a federal infrastructure bill would be positive for our country and our business\\nAs expected, in the middle of the spring and summer selling season, the backlog for construction industries was down from the first quarter of 2017. However, the decrease this quarter of about $300 million was less than the first quarter to second quarter reductions in both 2015 and 2016 when the backlog went down by $1 billion and $900 million respectively\\nOrder rates were strong in the quarter with all regions seeing an improvement from year ago\\nLet's move to slide seven\\nConstruction Industries segment profit was favorable by about $350 million driven by favorable price realization and higher sales volume, including a favorable mix of products\\nPeriod costs were about flat as higher short-term incentive compensation expense was largely offset by restructuring and cost reduction actions\\nConstruction Industries was an early adopter of our operating and execution model, and this focus has helped to improve their segment profitability\\nSegment profit margin in the quarter was 18.2%, an increase of almost 600 basis points from the second quarter of last year\\nLet's move to slide eight and Resource Industries\\nContinued strong demand for after-market parts to support overhauls and maintenance work combined with favorable changes to dealer inventories were the primary drivers of the $300 million increase in sales and revenues for Resource Industries; an increase of 21%\\nIn order to call a recovery in mining, we have said that first the excess machine inventory in the mines would need to be worked off\\nThen demand for overhauls and maintenance would drive higher aftermarket part sales\\nAnd last, orders for new equipment would start to increase\\nThe cycle is starting to play out\\nUtilization on trucks is up 4% from last year\\nThe part fleet continues to come down, and for the fifth quarter in a row, part sales have increased to support rebuild and maintenance needs as well as higher utilization of fleets in the mines\\nAnd our order rates are improving\\nAfter four years of dealers reducing their inventories, for the second sequential quarter, dealer inventory held about flat\\nSales increases and favorable dealer inventory changes were broad based across all regions\\nAs you saw in the sales to user numbers that were released yesterday, RI sales to users were about flat in the quarter\\nHowever, we believe sales to users are a lagging indicator of industry trend\\nOrder rates in the quarter were up more than double the second quarter of last year\\nThe backlog for Resource Industries was up about $300 million from the end of the first quarter 2017, and Resource Industries was a significant part of the $3 billion increase in the backlog since the second quarter of last year\\nHowever, while Resource Industries has started to recover, sales volumes remain at historically low level\\nWe'll move to slide nine and look at their operating performance\\nOn improving sales with a focus on operational performance, Resource Industries delivered a solid quarter\\nSegment profit was $97 million, up $260 million from a loss of $163 million in 2016. The improvement in profit resulted from higher sales volume, including a favorable mix of products and lower period cost\\nResource Industries continues to implement a number of restructuring actions to lower their breakeven point\\nThese initiatives enabled them to deliver lower period cost in the quarter even after recognizing a large increase in short-term incentive compensation expense\\nResource Industries incurred additional warranty expense of a little over $50 million in the quarter for a customer program we do not expect to repeat\\nNext we'll go through Energy and Transportation on slide ten\\nSales were up $200 million or 5% in the quarter to $3.9 billion\\nHigher sales into oil and gas combined with higher industrial aftermarket sales were the primary drivers of the sales increase\\nSales into power generation were about flat as a slight improvement in North America was mostly offset by weaknesses in other regions\\nTransportation sales decreased, largely due to lower demand for marine application\\nSales into the rail industry were about flat\\nWhile the rail industry remains weak and the number of stored locomotives remains elevated, this was mostly offset in the quarter by an increase in rail services to support higher rail traffic\\nThe chart on the right side of slide 10 shows the four-year history of U.S\\nrig counts and west Texas intermediate oil prices\\nThe number of rigs in production has doubled from recent lows reached in May of 2016. U.S\\noil production has increased accordingly\\nIn the areas where we participate in the oil and gas market, the recent strength has largely been concentrated to well servicing and midstream gas compression applications\\nDemand for aftermarket parts to support overhaul and maintenance of well servicing fleets increased in the quarter, primarily to support rigs that are going back to work in the Permian Basin and other shale formations in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico where the cost of production and transportation is low enough to encourage investment despite recent oil price volatility\\nMidstream gas compression is having another good year as we support the continued buildout of North America's natural gas infrastructure\\nIn addition, recent developments in the Permian in the last 12 months have had a higher concentration of natural gas than previous wells\\nThis discovery has contributed to a higher demand for 3500 and 3600 reciprocating engines to support the midstream gas compression growth in that region\\nWe move to slide 11; we'll look at the segment for Energy and Transportation\\nEnergy and Transportation profit was up $98 million from $602 million to $700 million\\nThis was largely attributable to higher sales volume, a favorable impact from cost absorption and improved material cost\\nPeriod cost increased in the quarter but were about flat after excluding higher short term incentive compensation expense\\nBefore I move on to the outlook, a quick comment on financial products\\nOperating profit was down slightly due to the absence of the sale of securities at Cat Insurance Services\\nThe portfolio remains healthy with past dues down 22 basis points in the second quarter of 2016 and write-offs were down $7 million\\nUsed equipment prices continued to improve which helped, and the team delivered a solid quarter\\nWe'll move to slide 12, and we'll cover the outlook\\nWe announced this morning that we are raising the outlook for full year sales and revenues and profit per share\\nIn April we provided an outlook for sales and revenues of $38 billion to $41 billion\\nAs a result of strong operational performance in the first half, encouraging order rate, good economic indicators and a solid backlog, we are providing new guidance for sales and revenues in the range of $42 billion to $44 billion with a midpoint of $43 billion, up $3.5 billion from the prior outlook\\nAt the midpoint of the sales and revenues range, we have raised the profit per share outlook to $3.50 per share and raised the adjusted profit per share outlook from $3.75 to $5. We'll move on to slide 13 and cover the sales outlook by segment\\nWe now expect Construction Industries sales for the year to be up 10% to 15% versus the previous outlook of flat to up 5%\\nThis is driven largely by higher end user demand in both China and North America\\nOrder rates for Construction Industries have been strong through the first half of the year across most regions with an exception of the Middle East and Brazil which remain challenged\\nThe backlog is also up significantly from the second quarter of 2016. We do expect sales in the second half of the year to be slightly lower than the first half\\nFor Construction Industries, the second quarter is typically the strongest quarter of the year as construction activity and deliveries pick up to support the spring and summer construction season in the Northern Hemisphere\\nFewer workdays due to holidays and vacations combined with the anticipation of colder weather typically drives sales lower in the second half\\nIn China, on average for the last five years, over 55% of sales were realized in the first half of the year\\nFor Resource Industries, we now expect sales to be up 20% to 25% for the full year versus the previous outlook of up 10% to 15%\\nWhile we expect aftermarket part sales to remain strong through the rest of the year as the number of parked trucks is reduced and the demand for overhauls declines, we expect the rate of growth to slow, and for part sales to be lower in the second half than the first\\nHowever, we expect this will be more than offset by an increase in new equipment sales\\nEnergy and Transportation sales are forecasted to be up 5% to 10% for the year versus the previous outlook of about flat\\nWe continue to see strong rebuild activity in well servicing for engines, transmission, pumps, and flow iron, and new equipment deliveries are expected to increase in the second half of the year\\nWe also expect shipments to North America gas compression customers to be higher in the second half\\nIndustrial, power generation and transportation are all expected to be about flat to slightly up\\nWe move to slide 14. At the midpoint of the sales and revenue range, the new outlook for profit per share is $3.50 and the revised outlook for adjusted profit per share is $5. The increase in the profit outlook since April is largely the result of the improved forecast for sales and revenues and disciplined cost control partially offset by an increase in short term incentive compensation expense\\nAs compared to 2016 at the midpoint of the range, the revised outlook reflects higher sales and revenues of about $4.5 billion or 12%, and an increase in adjusted profit per share of $1.58. The increase in adjusted profit per share versus 2016 is largely driven by higher sales volume of $4.5 billion and the associated margin on those sales\\nFavorable price, while we do not expect the same level of price favorability in the second half of the year, we still expect favorable price realization for the full year in a range of 0.5% to 1%\\nFavorable impact from period cost absorbed as inventories are expected to increase to support higher production level\\nThese favorable items will be partially offset by higher short term incentive compensation expense of about $1 billion\\nMaterial costs are now expected to be about flat for the full year\\nWhile geopolitical uncertainty and commodity volatility continue to be risks to the outlook, our outlook assumes that oil prices remain bound within the recent range of volatility, markets stay resilient to geopolitical uncertainties, and China remains supportive of growth\\nHowever, changes to any of these variables as well as others could impact our sales and revenues outlook for the full year\\nWe'll turn to slide 15 and wrap up\\nOperational performance for the year has been strong with second quarter operating profit pull-through of nearly 50%\\nWhile a number of our end markets remain challenged, we see strong demand in deliveries for China construction and North America gas compression equipment\\nAnd demand for aftermarket parts has increased to support overhaul and maintenance activity for well servicing, gas compression, and mining equipment\\nOrders and end user demand for North American construction equipment also improved in the quarter\\nWe continue to be focused on lean, product quality, and investing in the business for future growth\\nThe balance sheet remains strong, and we delivered $2 billion in ME&T operating cash flow in the quarter\\nGiven year to date performance and our confidence in the second half of the year, we are raising the outlook for both sales and revenues and profit per share\\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Amy\\nAnn, this is Brad Halverson\\nMaybe just another comment about how we use that language\\nWe use that language because that's how we're operating internally\\nWe have now been through four years of a downturn\\nIt's been hard on us\\nWe've taken significant restructuring activities and we like where our cost structure is at and where our balance sheet is at\\nAnd so using our operating and execution model, Jim is really driving continued focus on cost reduction across the support areas, and as we increase period cost, you'll see that there'll be very targeted in areas that offer the most long term value for the company consistent with kind of the pools of OPACC we see out there in the future\\nAnd this is a little example in the second half of this year where we're going to take an opportunity to do a little bit of that where we think there's a lot of value and keep the lid on the other costs that we have in the company\\nYeah, I'd say, Ann, actually I think not because this time I've been in a career here at Cat a long time\\nTypically, we have reductions in areas that are easy to find\\nSo we reduce R&D or reduce other things\\nIn this downturn, if you look at our cost reduction, it's been highly targeted to areas that are not kind of future value\\nThey're areas of efficiency and consolidation and support cost\\nWe have really increased spending in many of the growth areas\\nWe've protected R&D by and large, and we've protected things like digital spending\\nSo we've taken an entirely different approach in this downturn in terms of where we took cost out and what cost we protected\\nSo I would say it's different than we would have historically done\",\n          \"Good morning, everyone\\nLet me start with the headlines for the quarter\\nSales and earnings were down slightly, reflecting a challenging environment, as Tom just described, and comparison to strong results last year\\nWe delivered significant cost savings in the quarter, and we've increased our full year cost savings outlook\\nAnd finally, we're on track with our overall capital plan\\nNow let's take a look at the details, starting with sales\\nOur second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, that's down 1% year-on-year due to lower organic sales\\nTom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes\\nOn profitability, second quarter gross margin was 36.1%, that's down 20 basis points year-on-year\\nOperating margin was 17.5%, down 50 basis points\\nWhile margins were down slightly overall, I'm encouraged with the improvements that we achieved in our Personal Care and K-C Professional business segments, and also in the developing and emerging markets overall\\nCommodities were a $75 million drag in the second quarter, and for the full year, we're now expecting inflation of $200 million to $300 million, that's $50 million higher than our previous estimate driven by higher pulp costs\\nOur teams continued to deliver significant FORCE cost savings\\nSecond quarter savings were $120 million and we've increased our full year savings target to $425 million to $450 million\\nOur original target was for savings of at least $400 million\\nGiven the current environment, we are also tightly managing our overhead spending\\nOn the bottom line, second quarter earnings per share were $1.49, down 3% year-on-year\\nLower equity income reduced earnings by $0.03 per share, offset by a lower share count and a slightly better effective tax rate\\nNow let's take a look at cash flow\\nCash provided by operations in the second quarter was $825 million, in line with our expectations\\nCash flow was down compared to $860 million in the year-ago quarter, including the impact of higher tax payments this year\\nSecond quarter working capital cash conversion cycle was down six days compared to full year 2016, bringing the year-to-date decline to five days\\nWe're making very good progress in this area, and we expect to nicely exceed our original one-day improvement target for the full year\\nWe also continue to manage capital spending in this environment, and we now expect that full year spending will be in the lower half of our $850 million to $950 million target range\\nOn capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $600 million\\nWe continue to expect that full year dividends and share repurchases will total between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion\\nLooking at our segments, in Personal Care, organic sales fell 1% due to lower net selling prices\\nOrganic sales were up 2% in developing and emerging markets but were down elsewhere\\nPersonal Care operating margins were 20.6%, up 60 basis points\\nThe improvement was driven by cost savings, partially offset by lower selling prices and higher input costs\\nIn Consumer Tissue, organic sales were down 2%, driven by North America\\nOverall, Consumer Tissue operating margins were 16.5%, down 190 basis points\\nThe results were impacted by lower sales and higher pulp costs\\nIn K-C Professional, organic sales in the quarter were up 1%, with gains in all major geographies\\nK-C Professional operating margins were 20.1%, up 150 basis points\\nThe comparison included benefits from cost savings\\nSo in summary, our second quarter results were impacted by difficult environment with weaker economies, category softness and increased competitive activity\\nNonetheless, we are achieving strong cost savings, we're generating healthy cash flow, and we're allocating capital in shareholder-friendly ways\\nI'll now turn the call back over to Tom\\nYeah, we do continue to deliver significant cost savings through the FORCE program, and we were able to take up the full year target\\nAnd what I'd say is that as the program name implies, our teams really are Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere\\nWhen you look at our supply chain savings that includes improving productivity and waste across our manufacturing operations, driving down the cost of our facilities, optimizing the cost of our product specifications and continually negotiating lower input costs or material costs of our products\\nAnd year-to-date, we are at 4% of cost of goods, which is really a strong performance, not only internally but benchmarks very well\\nI continue to see opportunities for us to continue to deliver the FORCE cost savings as we move forward\\nSo good performance there, and I think more opportunity there\\nSure\\nOn the buyback, the $800 million to $1 billion is still the right number for the year\\nWe're on track with that\\nAnd in terms of the interest expense, we did some pre-funding on the $950 million that comes due in August, which is why you see a higher debt number at the end of the quarter, but that should normalize\\nAnd the debt that we'll take out in August is a pretty high coupon, it's 6.125%, and so that will be replaced with lower interest rate debt and that should bring the interest expense down for the year\",\n          \"Thanks, Rob\\nGood morning, everyone, and welcome to Walmart's investor relations call to discuss third quarter earnings\\nThis is Steve Schmitt, and I'm joined today by, Kary Brunner, Michael Brigance, Joey Smith, and Miguel Garcia from the IR team\\nHopefully, you've seen our materials we issued this morning\\nI'm going to hit on a couple of key points in a minute, and then we'll open the call for Q&A\\nThere will be forward-looking statements on today's call, which are subject to future events and uncertainties\\nActual results could differ materially from these statements\\nPlease review the full Safe Harbor statement accompanying our earnings materials\\nSo let me talk about a few highlights in the quarter\\nWe had a really strong quarter\\nWe have broad-based growth\\nOn a constant currency basis, consolidated net sales were up 3.8%, an increase of $4.5 billion\\nWe delivered adjusted EPS of $1. You notice our GAAP EPS was $0.58 a share\\nSo we adjusted GAAP EPS for three items that are detailed in the release, I'll hit on the three of them\\nWe recently completed a debt tender offer\\nWe made an FCPA accrual regarding possible resolution of the FCPA matter\\nWe made the exit of certain properties in one of our international markets\\nSo excluding these items, our adjusted EPS was $1. We have good momentum in sales growth across the business\\ncomp sales growth was 2.7%, with comp traffic up 1.5%\\nWe saw about a 30 to 50 point positive impact to the comp from recent hurricanes\\nOur Walmart U.S\\neCommerce sales grew 50%\\nSam's comp sales grew 2.8% led by traffic and also had a benefit from the hurricanes\\nInternational delivered another solid quarter with 10 of 11 markets reporting positive comp sales\\nExcluding the charge for the FCPA accrual we disclosed today, we would have leveraged expenses as a company in the quarter, which has been a point of emphasis for us\\nWe're now expecting full year adjusted EPS of $4.38 to $4.46, which is an increase from our prior guidance of $4.30 to $4.40. Fourth quarter Walmart U.S\\ncomp sales are expected to increase between 1.5% and 2% on more difficult compares\\nJust a couple of reminders\\nWe'll release our fourth quarter earnings on February 20, 2018. And like to let everyone know that next year's earnings release dates will be posted to our website\\nSo please mark your calendars for that\\nAnd at this point, we'd be happy to take your questions\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nThanks, Michael\\nLet me talk about maybe two things; gross margin on a consolidated basis, and then on a U.S\\nbasis\\nSo on a consolidated basis, gross profit rate declined 29 basis points\\nAnd you hit on several of the items, so on a consolidated basis, we have price investments in certain markets, mix effects of eCommerce, which you mentioned, and keep in mind the U.S\\nhurricane-related expenses that we had\\nI'd also like to point your attention to operating margin and some of the things that just we'd like you to pay attention to, as we called out some items such as the FCPA accrual, international impairments, and hurricane impacts\\nSo just keep these in mind when you're looking at overall operating profit performance in the quarter\\nFor Walmart U.S\\nspecifically, gross profit margin declined 36 basis points in the quarter\\nPrice investments, as you mentioned, mix effects of eCommerce impacted as well\\nAnd the hurricane specifically, we estimate impacted the gross profit decline of about a third of that\\nSo I'm not getting into all the details specifically, we continue to invest in price\\nWe're operating with more discipline, and we'll continue to look ways to manage our margin, and ways that work for our customers and work for our shareholders\\nIt's really the productivity beginning to turn for us\\nSo you could see gross profit margin pressure from time-to-time, and we need to get more disciplined with expenses\\nSo if you think about our business, and certainly our DNA, we're about offering everyday low prices, both in-store and online\\nThe fact is, some products are just cheaper to sell in stores, think about items like bottled water, so you'll see some price differences from time-to-time\\nThanks, Oliver\\nSo the first question around smart cart technology\\nIt's something that we continue to look at\\nWe need to be thoughtful about it as we think about putting that potentially on Walmart\\ncom, but nothing really more to add at this time\\nIn terms of the Lord & Taylor relationship, it's going to be a unique experience\\nThink about it as a flagship store\\nThis is expected to launch in the spring\\nIt will be dedicated store on Walmart\\nWe're excited about the relationship, the deep relationships Lord & Taylor has with great brands, and we know our customers look for premium brands on our site\\nSo we think it's a good agreement, and we look forward to the spring\\nWell, I think there's a lot of things\\nIf you talk to Greg Foran, the CEO of our U.S\\nbusiness, he could probably list a list of 20 to 30, maybe even more than that, from the time the customer walks in the door to the time they check out, from a booking standpoint\\nSo, we continue to look at it\\nI think you can tell in our results, the customers like the changes that we're making in our stores, and we'll continue to look to make a better experience so they continue shopping with us\\nWe continue to make progress on inventory\\nYou've seen more incremental improvements versus, I'd say, the step change improvements we saw last year, and we'll continue to look for improvements we can make in the business\\nI think it's a fair way to look at it, Simeon\\nWell, if you think about Jet, and thanks for bringing that up\\nJet was in the comp for a month, the way our comp calculations work\\nSo there really wasn't much of an impact in the third quarter results\\nReally the way we think about eCommerce is really in total\\nJet is a piece of our eCommerce business overall\\nWe made the decision earlier this year to give more transparency on our U.S\\neCommerce business, and we furthered that in our October meeting, so we'll continue to report on the eCommerce business as a whole\\nIn terms of a glide path, we feel good about the direction of our eCommerce business\\nI think this quarter is another good example of that and we will report that as we go\\nBut in terms of any glide path or volatility, we'll wait and see\\nThank you\\nMaybe I'll give a few comments and turn it over to Kary to give a little more detail\\nSo we'll take the inflation piece first\\nSo the way we've reported inflation on food is really excluding the price investment that we've made and as we got into this quarter we think it's a very \\u2013 it's \\u2013 you talked about what Brett said in his remarks, which is in a similar range or below what we reported which was 30 basis points of inflation in the past quarter\\nThe fact is it's getting a little bit more difficult for us to really be precise with that number as we look at our price investment markets\\nAs we anniversary some of those price investments, it's just becoming a little bit more difficult, so we'll give you as directional as a number as we can to help you analyze that business going forward\\nIn terms of the grocery business or the food business overall specifically, you mentioned online grocery pick up\\nWe know that that's working for our customers\\nWe continue to expand it\\nWe're in 1,100 locations now and expect to add another 1,000 next year\\nSo that's a big initiative for us\\nIt's working and our customers love it\\nIn terms of other things that are working, it's, again, it's a lot of different things\\nIt's expanding assortment, it's quality of product, having in-stocks and price is a component of it as well\\nKary, anything else you want to add?\\nWe won't give the specifics of that\\nIt's working for us based on our rollout plans\\nThanks, Robby\\nAnd I appreciate it\\nSo I think we have to manage labor costs like we manage other expenses in our business\\nOne of the big initiatives that we have is, as we grow the business we want to be more disciplined with our costs\\nWe need to be more efficient\\nWe talked about some of the technology enablers that are helping with that\\nWe have to manage labor costs and we have to look to do that in the most efficient way we can to reach the margin objectives that we have\\nSo that's what we continue to do\\nI think you think about freight just like the other variables that we manage in the business\\nWe have a lot of experience managing the P&L and whether it's labor or freight, we have to pull different levers to deliver on the objective that we have in the freight would be no exception\\nBut I don't have any specifics for you in terms of freight cost increasing\\nRob, next question please?\\nWell, you mentioned the sales piece of it which certainly helped\\nBut it's really about becoming more disciplined with our expenses overall\\nI know we had been talking about that for a while now and it's a big objective of ours going forward\\nThere's not one thing, it's just about being more efficient with the business overall\\nIt's great that we started to see that in the third quarter\\nWe've talked about our goals next year to leverage expenses and we'll continue to push towards that\\nBut it's not one thing, it's a lot\\nThanks, Karen\\nRob, next question please?\\nThanks for your question\\nSo, we continue to execute our pricing strategy that we laid out, I guess, two years ago now\\nThe details of that, and you're not going to be surprised to hear me say that, that we keep pretty close to the vest\\nSo pricing is a piece of what we're doing, along with customer experience and all the other initiatives that we have to grow the top line\\nSo we're not going to give specific details of pricing, but we continue to execute the strategy, and our customers are responding\\nWell, if you think about the Walmart customer base overall, it's actually a pretty good mirror image of the U.S\\npopulation in general\\nWe're pleased with how new customers are using us in multiple ways, and really an omni experience we laid out in our October meeting, that the omni customer certainly spends more with us than single channel customers\\nSo we continue to push that forward\\nIn terms of different age groups or whatnot that are adopting at a faster order, we don't have that particular information\\nBut we continue to move customers into the omni experience at Walmart, to use our brands in different ways\\nWe're expanding our online grocery pick up, almost doubling it next year\\nWe'll continue to do that, because we know that that's where the customer wants to use us in multiple channels, and we'll continue to forge ahead with that\\nWe do quite a bit of research as you would expect, Chuck\\nSo there's a lot of scientific data that we get, now I won't give you a scientific answer\\nThe real \\u2013 I think the nuts and bolts of it is that we think the customers reasonably, I mean, is doing reasonably well\\nWe haven't seen a marked change over the last several quarters, certainly in our results we continue to, I mean, this quarter is a good indication that our initiatives are appealing to the customer, but we don't see a marked change in customers right now\\nThat's really a different product mix and more than anything\\nIn terms of the associate delivery test, we continue to learn from what we're doing\\nIt's certainly an initiative that leverages the unique assets that we have\\nBut not only associate delivery, but ground-based platforms to solve for last mile for really quick delivery for our customers\\nSo we continue to watch that and learn from it\\nAnd nothing you can tell from our fourth quarter guidance of 1.5% to 2% that we feel pretty good about the momentum we have\\nMaybe I'll take the second part of your question first Paul\\nIn terms of the hurricane piece, I think we're as specific as we can be with what we laid out in the quarter with the Walmart U.S\\nbusiness, the 30 to 50 point comp benefit\\nSam's I think was 70 to 90 basis points\\nWe talked about the net of sales and increased cost, gross margin and SG&A to be about $150 million headwind for the U.S\\nbusiness and about $20 million for Sam's\\nSo I think we probably gave as much information as we could from that standpoint\\nIn terms of Sam's overall, I think in the comp piece of it, what I'd point you to more than anything is strong traffic\\nSo a 3.6% member traffic growth\\nWe have members coming in more frequently\\nWe have initiatives like Scan and Go that make it easier for members to come in and shop at clubs\\nAnd that's what I would point you to is traffic up 3.6% in the quarter\\nMatt, it's really the same factors that have driven health and wellness and relatively consistent performance\\nThere was a pick up this quarter as we continue to see script growth in our pharmacy, traffic is very healthy and we also have some new items in over-the-counter that are doing well and some of that obviously is driven by sickness so Cold, Cough & Flu (26:44) was strong this quarter, but branded drug inflation as well is a fact there, but really kind of the same factors that you've heard us talk about over the last couple of quarters, just a bit of a pickup in traffic this quarter\\nI mean, we did see some higher dollar purchases from the GM side\\nSee from a geography standpoint it's SG&A, SG&A overall\\nAnd one thing to point out on the FCPA is, it did drive the quarterly tax rate up\\nSo if you're looking at the year-over-year tax rate, the majority of it was driven by that particular accrual\\nI think the key is to be flexible\\nIf you look at some of the partnerships we've had around the business, I'd point you to JD initially in China, to partner with really one of the largest eCommerce platforms in China, that's where a partnership makes sense\\nYou have brands that we acquired, like Bonobos specifically, that give us really the unique access to great brands like Bonobos that we can leverage to be (29:14) proprietary to our platforms\\nAnd then you have things like Lord & Taylor that you can partner, a capital-light way to bring great brands to your site that we think would work for both parties\\nSo I think the key is to be flexible, and we'll continue to be flexible as we look to build our assortment and give customers more options\\nI think it's tough to dissect and I don't have any, I don't think, useful information, particularly on ladies apparel\\nBut, look, when you have a business of our scale that's growing like we did in the third quarter, I think you're taking share\\nIt's hard to dissect on who from\\nSo I don't really have any color on any specifics on that for you\\nBut thanks for your question, Kate\\nThanks for the question\\nI think it's TBD\\nI think we'll continue to test, learn, and move forward\\nWe have a lot of initiatives underway\\nA lot of you that came to Bentonville last month saw a lot of them, there were things that we're doing in-store that we're excited about\\nSo I think you'll see us test, take some swings, see what works, and expand and fail fast on some initiatives too\\nWe certainly take a look at the competitive environment, that's something we've done at Walmart for a long time\\nSo we continue to do that\\nOur brand is about everyday low prices on baskets of goods, that's where the customers trust our brands for and (32:12) we'll continue to make sure we do that\\nBigger baskets was a piece of it, Scot\\nIt's over 70 million\\nIn the last summer, we gave, I think it was 67 million\\nSo we continue to make progress\\nThank you\\nThanks for your question, Joe\\nAnd we appreciate you notice in the KitchenAid's part of our assortment now and you may have seen that we also have Bose, which is \\u2013 it's a great brand that now is associated with us\\nSo, you worry about that, I think you always watch and learn and we look at the data\\nWe analyze the data really well\\nWe know that customers are looking for premium brands on our website\\nWe think it helps the brand overall\\nSo we'll watch brands like that\\nWe're happy to have them as part of our assortment and we'll continue to learn\\nI think pricing is a piece of it\\nBut I think over the last, call it, at least 12 months maybe closer to 18 months now, there's been an increased focus on getting back to the basics, giving the customer a better experience and we're starting to see some green shoots there\\nThanks, guys\\nWe don't have any more questions in the queue\\nSo I just wanted to thank everyone for their time, for your interest in Walmart and happy holidays\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Stock_Ticker\",\n
