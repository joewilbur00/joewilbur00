# Wildfire Risk Analysis in the U.S.

This notebook explores the environmental and seasonal factors contributing to wildfire size using historical data. It includes regression modeling and EDA to identify high-risk conditions.

## Key Components
- Cleaned and filtered wildfire incident records
- Explored fire size distribution by cause and month
- Built a linear regression and random forest model to identify key risk factors (temperature, precipitation, etc.)

## Purpose
To assist in predictive modeling for wildfire risk management and resource planning.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Statsmodels, Matplotlib)
- Regression and random forest analysis and visualization
