## Featured Projects

### [Fantasy Football Draft Aid](./Fantasy-Football-Aid)
Predicted fantasy football outcomes for the 2025 season at the QB, WR, RB, and TE positions. Created a stramlit interfact integrated with an LLM that suggests players to draft based on team needs and best players available. 

### [Classification of Melanoma Images](./Melanoma-Detection-CNN)
Built Convolutional Neural Networks to classfify melanoma images as either benign or malignant. Implemented torchvision transforms and multi-block CNN structure to bolster performance. 

### [Baseball Savant SQL Analysis](./Baseball-Savant-SQL-DB)
Structured and queried MLB player data in MySQL to deliver performance insights using advanced SQL (CTEs, window functions, views). Created custom queries for sprint speed, run value, and power metrics.

### [Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Analysis](./SAF-Analysis)
Built linear and time-series models to forecast jet fuel prices and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of SAF for airlines. Supports sustainability recommendations with data-backed projections.

### [Earnings Call Volatility Prediction](./Earnings-Calls-SentAnalysis-TopicModeling-Analysis)
Used FinBERT sentiment scores and LDA topic distributions to predict short-term stock volatility following earnings calls. Built and evaluated a Random Forest classifier for binary volatility classification.

### [Topic Modeling of Academic Articles](./Academic-Article-Topic-Modeling)
Applied LDA to uncover thematic structures in academic abstracts, enabling document clustering and topic classification. Preprocessed text and visualized dominant topic distributions.

### [Twitter Sentiment Classifier](./Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis)
Cleaned and labeled tweets to build a logistic regression model using TF-IDF vectorization. Classified sentiment and evaluated performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## [Fire Risk Analysis](./Fire-Risk-Analysis)
Analyzed historical wildfire data to identify environmental and seasonal factors influencing fire size across the U.S. Conducted exploratory analysis and built a linear regression model using variables such as temperature, precipitation, and cause of ignition to quantify fire risk.
