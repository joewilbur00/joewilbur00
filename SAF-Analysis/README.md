# Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Cost Analysis

This project evaluates the financial feasibility of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) adoption by analyzing and projecting conventional jet fuel costs. It combines time-series forecasting and regression modeling to identify trends in fuel pricing, which can inform strategic planning for airlines seeking low-carbon alternatives.

## ðŸ“‚ Notebooks

### 1. Projected_Jet_Fuel_Cost.ipynb
- Collected and cleaned historical jet fuel price data
- Visualized trends and seasonality
- Built time-series projections of future jet fuel prices

### 2. Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb
- Modeled SAF productions growth using linear regression
- Quantified long-term trend using slope and RÂ²

## Objective
To create a data-backed baseline of conventional jet fuel costs for comparison with SAF, supporting both investment decisions and sustainability policy recommendations.

## Techniques Used
- Time-series forecasting
- Linear regression modeling
- Data cleaning and visualization

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)
